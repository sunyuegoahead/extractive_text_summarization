Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.
I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I'm convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.
For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes.
Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family's life crosses Dexter's life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do.
This is a funny episode that gives a big slap in the face of the conspiracy theorists, I can't help but think that Parker and Stone wanted to give their opinions on the subject in this episode rather than just be intelligent about it.Episode 10: Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy: Eric Cartman is selected to become South Park elementary schools hall monitor, so he dons the look of a bounty hunter and sets out to clean up the halls.
You see the SP boys fat and pimply and, by tilting the box, you see their World of Warcraft characters.Disc 1:"The Return of Chef"--Controversial episode that got back at Isaac Hayes for leaving SP when it tackled the Scientology issue.
Like in this special case, where Jack has a mission that a demon or a possessed human could not accomplish since they could not enter the pentacle, but otherwise demons only take possession of human bodies and use them as "meat suits"But this second season has a touch of itself first of all in the constant debate about the worthiness of the fight, the worthiness of one brother being ready to die for the other and vice versa (if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself.)
"; "Rob's Directing Experience"; "Favorite Guest Star Moments"; "Veronica Mars: Mean Girl" - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; "The Politics of Veronica Mars" - concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his "Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments" and his "Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments"; "Do-Overs? "
The head of the CW, Dawn Ostroff, says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone, she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project, which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS, in which the plot would shoot to the future, to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent.
When the boys learn to mystery behind the onslaught of beggars, can they, with the help of some old school NWA & The Posse 8-Ball "City of Compton" style rap, save the day?Le Petit Tourette"--Cartman sees a kid cussing uncontrollably in a toy store and learns that the kid has Tourette's Syndrome (is this a subject right up SP's alley, or what?!).
It's a pretty hefty ensemble cast, but JERICHO gravitates towards the Greens, Jericho's first family and led by patriarch and town mayor Johnston Green (a wonderfully understated Gerald McRaney), who also happens to be an ex-Army Ranger.
And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes.
My favorite character: Kate `Starbuck'!Though I did not like Battlestar Galactica Razor, and actually started Season 3 with low expectations because of it, I ended up loving Season 3.Season 2 ended with the Cylons discovering and invading New Caprica.
I do not shy away from giving away what happens in each season so DO NOT read my reviews if you have not already watched ALL of the seasons (I sometimes give away things in later seasons in reviews for earlier seasons as well, so be careful if you have not watched all the way through season 6).Second, despite the tone of my reviews I really enjoy the show.
The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin.
We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House.
BUFFY had two season finales that were as good as any I've seen (Seasons Two and Five -- the climatic scene from the Season Five finale, "The Gift," was recently voted in landslide fashion on the official Emmy 2008 website as the Most Memorable Moment in TV history), but because Joss Whedon was always and wisely terrified of the cancellation of his shows, he would not end any season on a cliffhanger.
I was really impressed by the Vince Gilligan's writing and the talent of Bryan Cranston (who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for "BREAKING BAD") in such a demanding role.I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching the series because I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch a television series that may glorify crystal meth and it's good to know that the series doesn't.In fact, it's more about a television series about a very intelligent man making a very stupid decision that will eventually take him to the lowest of lows in order to make money for his family and his treatment.It's so shocking that Walter H. White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.And that is what is so impressive with "BREAKING BAD" is that it's a series that is well-written, smart but dark, shocking and even disturbing at times.
It's more about living with your wrong decisions and watching as Walter and Jesse attempt to save themselves from the decisions they made.As the series progresses (only 7 episodes) we watch as Walter comes to life.
We only hear what she says, and it is cryptic at best, but it is very effective at making the scene creepy and spine tingling.Then, Laura continues to search and when the truth is finally revealed, we feel everything she feels.I guess, long story - short (I know, too late), what I am trying to say is Guillermo Del Toro is quietly trying to revive the ghost story, the horror film, and wants us to feel the genuine scares and chills behind the characters and the stories.
But Liz's boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin, "Knots Landing", "Beetlejuice", "Pearl Harbor") decides to add comedian Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan, "Saturday Night Live", "Scare Tactics") to spice up the show and rename it "TGS with Tracy Jordan".The show focuses on what goes behind-the-scenes of the creation of the show and what is going on in the personal lives of several of the main characters (primarily focusing on the lives of Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy) and focuses on relationships and the unique friendship that Jack and Liz tend to develop, while the two deal with their own love life but also their interaction with the writers of TGS and the NBC Page Kenneth Parcell (Jack MacBrayer, "Forgetting Sarah Marshall", "Arrested Development").
Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply the two best comic performers on TV and together they have created one of the great comic duos in TV history.There were some great comic arcs in Season Three.
There are those who try to mess with them or steal SAMCRO's shipments such as the white supremacist group known as the "Nords", their Latino rivals from Oakland known as the "Mayans" and possibly other dangers including the authorities.The first season of "Sons of Anarchy" focuses on member Jax (Charlie Hunman, "Undeclared", "Hooligans"), a member who tends to takes care of operations for the club and is quite respectful of his allegiance to the club that his father John had started and ran until his death many years ago.SAMCRO is now run by Clarence "Clay" Morrow (Ron Perlman, "Hellboy" films and "Beauty and the Beast") who married Jax's mother Gemma (Katey Sagal, "Married with Children", "Futurama", "8 Simple Rules...For Dating My Teenage Daughter") and have lived a life of making money but now are starting to feel the financial constraints.Both have made the Sons of Anarchy to a club that is profitable (due to the club's illegal dealings) but things start to change when Jax discovers his father's belongings especially with the discovery of his dead father's unpublished manuscript.
A buy out by the Chinese made for an interesting storyline as did Alan and Denny going before the Supreme Court one more time, the epitome of a lawyer's career, in the hopes of getting Denny the right to use non-FDA approved medication to stave off his disease.Of the characters in this series each offered something special that made you care about them all and want to continue to watch them.
Stan and his mom's disturbingly close relationship and the fates of Stan's mom's boyfriends cause Francine and Roger to investigate.
Despite being thieves, they are all likeable in their own way.It's one thing to have the typical series special features but "LEVERAGE" really goes all out with commentary for each episode and also, the special features that are on this DVD are probably a first (a featurette about the series getting renewed and a featurette on the cameras used on the series) and were quite enjoyable.
I gave Season Two five stars without any hesitation, though I also was the first to admit that it wasn't the work of perfection that Season One was.Frankly, based on pure business considerations, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS should have been cancelled at the end of Season Two.
Joss Whedon's "dollhouse" Season 1 is an enjoyable series that manages to captivates your attention form beginning to end.In 2009, Joss Whedon returned to television with his fourth television show (since "Buffy the Vampire Slayer, "Angel" and "Firefly") known as "dollhouse".The series received quite a bit of promotion for FOX and also became a series that featured less commercials (television spots were sold at a premium) and generated hype among many fans online who preferred to watch the series on [...].Needless to say, it was a series that didn't have the greatest of ratings but as of right now, FOX has greenlighted a second season.Here is a spoiler-free synopsis of what to find on "dollhouse" season 1:DISC 1:* Episode 1 - Ghost - We are introduced to "Echo" who is imprinted as a hostage negotiator and must save a child who has been kidnapped.
This Season One set comes in 4 discs and presents all twelve episodes, plus two unaired episodes (both of which are on disc 4): "Epitaph One" and the original pilot "Echo" (some of the scenes in "Echo" are integrated into the aired episodes, but there's enough never-before-seen material to make it worth watching - but you could see where the episode needed tightening up); audio commentary for three episodes: "Ghost" (with Joss Whedon & Eliza Dushku - really fun), "Man on the Street (with Joss Whedon), and "Epitaph One" (with Joss's brother Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, the happy couple who wrote the teleplay and who in their commentary track sometimes engage in playful lovey-dovey talk - also really fun); a whole gang of brief deleted scenes from nine of the episodes (my favorites of which are those depicting Sierra and November as bounty hunters in "Omega").Disc 4 also has these following featurettes: "Making DOLLHOUSE" is around 20 minutes long and offers insights into the casting choices and the two pilots made, as well as a look at "Epitaph One"; "Coming Home" - this is almost a reunion featurette, 7 minutes of Joss Whedon's staff warmly expounding on how glad they are to be working with him again; "Finding Echo" is about the magic of a hot Gouda pizza and of Joss and Eliza's friendship and how that led into their collaboration in DOLLHOUSE (5 minutes long); "Designing the Perfect DOLLHOUSE" is Joss giving a 6-minute tour of the amazing Dollhouse set; and "A Private Engagement" - the cast and crew share their thoughts on Dollhouse imprinting and, hey, is Joss Whedon a doll?
I had grown to have almost no interest in FOX and hadn't been watching any FOX shows in several seasons, but first with TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES and then with DOLLHOUSE and FRINGE, I thought it was finally becoming a network that was interested in exciting and complex programming.
But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly, "The Great Buck Howard" misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable.
featuring Veronica trying to have a relationship with her father and hair growing from Ted's desk, "Through Rose Colored Hazmat Suits" featuring Ted's daughter Rose bonding with Linda which makes Ted and Linda's sexual tension much more awkward and "Racial Sensitivity" which was just hilarious.As for the DVD release of "Better Off Ted - The Complete First Season", my only disappointment with this set is the fact that there are no special features included.
After a, for the most part, lackluster season 12, I looked forward to season 13 of my favorite show especially after seeing so many favorable reviews (usually, I do not get to see South Park episodes until they are released on DVD).
[If not a great season finale it does mock the stupidity of 2012, has a good running bit for Kyle and has the hilarious story of Cartmen believing he has become the world's last majority surrounded by minorities and singing an awesome song about it while making a true statement about America]This season set (Available in 3 disc DVD or 2 disc Blu-Ray) contains the same mini commentaries included on each season set since the third season.
Commentary:  Cedric Yarbrough and Niecy Nash talk about Cedric losing weight and other things, including what Raineesha should do to Junior next season--so they must have thought there would be a season 7.14.

But you must be prepared to show them you are quickening the pace, dumping the flashbacks & female sex addict, while beefing up the technology & redirecting this into a tech solutions team, with a super science geek, aspiring love story, exciting space occurrences & discoveries with a dynamic, memorable theme song.That is how you can make a second go at selling this idea.
But the agent doesn't get fired, because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer, withholding evidence, obstructing justice...you know, all those little things you'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies, logic errors and contrivances, the plots got increasingly incoherent, until NOBODY could follow what was going on.
From then on the first couple of episodes are up and down, sometimes they have interesting things going on, but for the most part it is a lot of boring dialog between characters I, and I know many other viewers too, just could not find likable.There is a stubborn scientist, a dork who beat a computer game and was asked to join the group to lend his expertise in being attempt at a non military or scientific perspective, a young girl who is irritating, boring, not in anyway any sort of eye candy, and certainly not a strong female role model like SG1 and Atlantis provided plenty of.
As Miss Simpson mentioned a "Bella" on the phone before she died, DCI Barnaby wonders if the deaths might be related.The Midsomer Worthy Writer's Circle invites best-selling author Max Jennings (John Shrapnel) to speak at their meeting in "Written in Blood".

"
Probably this is more a reflection of the difference between writing for a weekly TV audience, as opposed to viewers who binge-watch entire seasons on DVD - three weeks as opposed to three hours makes a big difference in how story arcs play out, and whether they "feel real" or not.Overall, though, the show is remarkable for its depth and honesty in exploring an amazing range of topics, showing a frankness about the difficulties of parenting, of negotiating sexuality and romance at a variety of ages, and about mental health and disability issues such as substance abuse and autism, all dealt with with a frankness that is surprising for network TV.
"Coon Vs. Coon & Friends"--In this final installment of the three-parter, Cartman and Cthulhu banish Cartman's former friends to the Nightmare City of R'lyeh while they wreak havoc to make the world a better place...for Cartman.
In fact, the acting by both male leads is so good, your sympathy shifts back and forth from the obviously sympathetic victim character Alice to the two males, who initially are totally unsympathetic (because you think you know who they are and what they're about to do).The Disappearance of Alice Creed is not a "big" film with crashing violence and lots of guns and explosions.
I found this segment racist, aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names, and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs.
Mark Davidson (Set Decorator) talks about the making of the bridge.Louis Ferreria vs. Colonel Young - (4:00) Colonel Young in his Larry King voice interviews Louis Ferreria and other cast members.Commentaries - Featuring "Alliances" with Ming-Na and Jamil Walker Smith, "Hope" with Jennifer Spence, Patrick Gilmore and Peter Kelamis, "Seizure" featuring Elyse Levesque and Brian J. Smith and "The Hunt" featuring Andy Mikita & Mark Savela.DISC 5:Pitches: A Journey of Friendship and Discovery - (25:41) Patrick Gilmore and Peter Kelamis talk about the friendships they made on the set of "Stargate Universe".Behind the Season 2 Finale - Gauntlet - (9:34) Crew and talent talk about working on the SG-U finale and how they feel about the series ending.Commentaries - "Common Descent" featuring Jennifer Spence & Patrick Gilmore, "Epilogue" featuring Jennifer Spence, PAtrick Gilmore and Mike Dopud, "Blockade" featuring Andy Mikita & John Lenic and "Gauntlet" featuring Andy Mikita, John Lenic and Lauren Bancroft-Wilson.JUDGMENT CALL:It's a shame that "Stargate Universe" was not given the chance to make their corrections and a shame that many fans abandoned the series.I've seen so many sci-fi TV series that started out dismally, finding new synergy and writers to improve the storyline of a series and I've seen networks give these sci-fi shows a chance.
I did notice that this second season featured less of Beck Oliver and shorter appearances by Tori's sister Trina and the episodes tend to focus on storylines that revolve around Tori, Andre, Jade, Robbie and Cat.As "Victorious" is on its third season, it's important to note that this is the complete second season of "Victorious" (whereas the first season was released in two DVD volumes).Overall, "Victorious" is a fun and enjoyable series and with the second season, the episodes continue its fun, crazy hijinks and good music.
"Best moment in the movie.Parting observations off the top of my head (and, I guess, a SPOILERS alert):- In the midst of fleeing the zeds, folks will insist on having meaningful discussions- snapping necks shouldn't kill zombies because the brain isn't affected (but it works in this movie)- Yes, absolutely, a desk with some chairs on it shoved against the door will keep out the zeds- Until a girl has a panic attack and starts dismantling that desk and chairs because, quote, "I need to get out!

Meeting Evil(released May/12)stars Samuel L. Jackson as Richie,Luke Wilson as John Felton and others,in this surprisingly enjoyable but tense thriller/drama about a man on the edge,who ignores the warning signs when a psychotic killer comes a calling.John Felton is a real estate agent who lives in a subdivision which has got more empty houses due to bankruptcy and foreclosures,than folks occupying them.He comes home,on his birthday,after losing his job and is contemplating his future when there is a knock on the door.Standing there is Richie,a black man,intense in nature,with a fedora,who says his car stalled in front of his house.He asks John for a push and he obliges him.After a few feet the car starts but as it does it stops suddenly,hurting Johns leg.Ritchie offers him a ride to the hospital and he reluctantly goes,despite his uneasy feeling about the man.Along the way John gets ever the more reluctant about Ritchie.They stop for gas where a young attendant gets on the wrong side of Ritchie.While John stays in the car Ritchie goes into the 7-11 style premises and John can see some kind of kerfuffle inside.Just then Ritchie reappears saying the gas was free,and they leave.Instead of going to the hospital they end up at a bar.John had forgotten his wallet,so he goes to a place that sells phones.The lady there is really rude and he leaves.He tries to use the phone inside the bar but has no money.He finds an old girlfriend inside who ultimately offers him and Ritchie a ride home.Before they leave Ritchie has paid a visit to the rude woman in the phone store and has returned verifying her attitude to John.Ritchie guides them to the impound(his car had been towed in front of the bar),but time passes and they are getting farther and farther to nowhere.By this time Ritchie has become much stranger in his behaviour.A trucker suddenly comes up and runs the car off the road,and the driver confronts John.He tells John he murdered his girlfriend(the unfriendly phone woman).Unnoticed by the trucker,Ritchie gets in Johns girlfriend's car and runs the driver over,and they leave.They find a farm driveway soon after and they drive into it.It is apparent Ritchie knows the place,but John finds a phone and is able to get part of his call out to the police about the incident on the highway,before he is cut off.By now John and his girlfriend know this man is just not right in the head and are very uneasy about their safety.Ritchie confines both to the farm,when a cop drives up.While Ritchie kills the cop,the two escape and head out through cornfields and part ways.John walks for a long time until he finally reaches a roadway and a cop car finally arrives.He drops to his knees,only to find the cop is Ritchie in disguise.Ritchie makes John put on the troopers hat and while Ritchie slumps in the back seat,John drives right through a police barricade.Once past Ritchie lets John out and he runs for freedom.He reaches a busy highway and starts stopping cars for help.A police car finally arrives and arrests him for the number of murders they think he has committed.John explains about Ritchie but they do not believe him.Eventually his girl friend shows up in police custody and she verifies his story.John is let free and his wife is there to meet him at the police station.Back home the two are settling back in when there is a knock at the door.Unbeknownst to his wife,who answers,it is Ritchie in disguise as a cop.He comes in and they start chatting.Not too far along she starts getting suspicious about him because of his off hand remarks.When John comes into the living room the cat is out of the proverbial bag.Ritchie explains that his wife has been unfaithful to him by having relations with the pool man;the very reason he came in the first place.Coincidentally(or not),at the beginning of the film when John arrived home,he was greeted by the pool man walking out his driveway.John holds his wife at knife point,at Ritchie's urgings,and when Ritchie approaches John,John stabs him instead.A fight ensues which ends up in a mud hole in the backyard,filled with rain water.The police arrive,and at the critical moment they shoot Ritchie dead.The film ends as John and his wife sit in bed,with the wife asking whether everything will be alright.There is no answer.This film makes one think of what one would do in John's shoes,i.e.would we ignore the warning signs?It makes one identify easier with John as he gets sucked down ever more into Ritchie's quagmire.Jackson plays Ritchie beautifully.He has this maniacal look and attitude,but is always just sitting on the edge.He doesn't go over the edge at John,whom for some reason he"likes",but takes things out on others like the lady who offended John at the phone place,or the customers and employees of the 7-11 style gas store.You wait for Ritchie to lose it on John,but it never happens.But that also keeps the tension high at all times.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp.There are,unfortunately,no extras.All in all a nice,taut thriller which has Samuel Jackson on top of his game playing an intense,psychotic killer type,who stalks Wilson,who is at his wits end in his life.Wilson learns alot about himself and his life through it all.4 solid stars.
Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko's hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant.

360(released July/12) stars Sir Anthony Hopkins,Jude Law,Rachel Weisz and many others.It's a well done filmic study in characters whose paths are linked either directly or indirectly,and the differing paths their ultimate decisions take them on.The cast was well picked with all doing a solid job.The story starts off with a young European lady at a photog's place of business.The man is really a photog/pimp.He puts up clients photos on the internet,filters the incoming calls and sends his beauties out into the world to make money for himself and them.Her first job as Blanka,is to meet up with Jude Law,a visiting businessman,at a bar.As he walks towards her he is stopped by two businessmen he had talked to previously,who now,of all times,want to accept his offer.Law tells them he is going to deal elsewhere.One of the men spies Blanka and starts to ramble on about her being a hooker,even getting her pic and name on his phone.Law,to avoid embarrassment,has to leave the bar and stand her up.Later that evening in his hotel room,Law gets a call from the businessman who actually met and paid her.She told him Laws name.Their business arrangement will now be renegotiated due to what he has on Law.The scene switches to a dentist who has a thing for his assistant.He seeks help with his emotions with a therapist and his imaan.He even goes so far as to follow her to the airport.Law's wife,in the meantime,has had an on going affair with a young Brazilian photog who works for her company.Today she is having one last fling with him and ending her affair.The photog goes home only to find HIS Brazilian girlfriend has left him because of his affair with Law's wife.She flies back to Rio.Law returns home and both he and his wife are uncomfortable because of their individual personal problems that neither,of course,know about.The one thing they do have in common at this time is their young daughter.The scene switches to a convicted sex offender and his case worker.Seems the six year jailed convict is being allowed out and is flying home by himself.He is quite uncomfortable with the prospect,but his case worker is there for him.On a flight over the U.S.,the Brazilian girl on her way to Rio meets up with elderly Hopkins.It turns out he is a recovering alcoholic and is going to Arizona to identify a body which may or may not be his daughter,who disappeared some years before.Stranded at Denver Airport due a snowstorm,the two decide to meet up later for a drink at a bar.Fate intervenes and she instead meets up with the convicted sex criminal.She ends up coercing him back to her hotel room,and he is clearly uncomfortable.Her advances drive him to lock himself in the washroom.When he finally comes out she is asleep.Hopkins,the next day,worried seeks the girl out when her flight is boarding.He finds her and they say their goodbyes.Hopkins gets to his destination and finds the body is not his daughters.At an AA meeting that night he relates the background of his daughters disappearance(she may be alive).Also at that AA meeting is the dental assistant who is there visiting relatives.It seems her marriage is on the rocks and when she returns home she is telling her hubby it is all over.This she does,and just as he is leaving on a business trip.When she returns to work her conflicted boss tells her he has to let her go.Her hubby meanwhile has gone to the airport to meet his boss,who has some crime connections and is in town to to meet up with a girl he has lined up for him.It turns out the girl is none other than Blanka,but things don't go well.She calls her pimp who arrives and shoots the man,leaving Blanka at the scene unconscious.The hubby has watched things go down and flees the scene.Blanka's sister,who went along to every job with Blanka,had struck up a convo with the hubby earlier,and now decides to leave with him.Law's marriage has now recovered.And the film comes to its conclusion as we see all the major characters go across the screen,all on the new paths they have chosen/made for themselves.The last character study I recently saw was the Marigold Hotel,but unlike that,this one has its stars,but not to the same extent.Marigold's characters lives converged at the hotel,but here we have people from all over the world coming together in some way,shape or form,with some strand of commonality.I also found this movie far more satisfying than Marigold.The direction here is quite good,as is the editing to get all these divergent stories together to make a whole,coherent story.They also "play" with us a bit in this film.There is a moment when the sex offender is alone in the room with the girl flying to Rio.She is asleep and he is gently stroking her.The camera fades into next day and Hopkins is looking for her to say goodbye.We don't expect he will find her but he does.No,the violent moment is put off until Blanka sleeps with the criminal and it goes wrong.Nicely played.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include three featurettes.All in all a nicely done character study;well acted and directed.Recommended.
Instead, each woman is hotter looking than the one before, and, no doubt, we can figure out the subsequent lookers' fates once we've seen `em.Not only that, but also this ritual - Reynolds calls them "rites" for a reason, kiddies - has been going on for 25 years ... and yet no one has ever come up with the idea to simply close shop, take your good-looking women and children, and leave town every March 21st in order to escape the ensuing annual bloodshed and mayhem.
Craigslist Joe is a nice film, something reasonably nice to watch, nicely filmed, nicely edited, nicely done.
Like many such episodic horror film, the introductory story additionally moves on briefly in between the shorts with interesting developments.These short films vary substantially in film, acting, gore, direction and writing quality.
Interviews with Dichen Lachman, Daniel Lissing, set designer Brenda Meyers-Ballard and Michael Crow (construction coordinator).Turning Point - (4:55) Shawn Ryan and Karl Gajdusek (co-creators and executive producers) talk about the episode involving James King and how the USS Colorado was brought into this conspiracy.The Mole - (4:39) Co-creator/executive producer Karl Gajdusek and Jessica Camacho discuss the mole on "Last Resort".Serrat's Lair - (4:49) Producer Jean Higgins, Sahr Ngaujah and other cast members talk about Serrat's character and his compound.I, Kylie - (5:01) Co-creator/executive producer Karl Gajdusek talks about the character of Kulie, interview with Autumn Reeser about her character and more.Epilogue - (5:00) The creators and the cast talk about how to end the series.EXTRAS:"Last Resort: The Complete Series" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to prime-time dramas, one can hope to watch and see something unique and different.While "Last Resort" may not have lasted several seasons long, the fact is that co-creator and executive producers Shawn Ryan and Karl Gajdusek took on a story that is farfetched but yet, gave us this alternate reality of "what if?
I believe that fans of the show got a &#34;We love you&#34; note from the writers and producers when Lori, during a scene with Rick, says, &#34;Look, I know that I'm a shitty wife...and I'm not winning any Mother-of-the-Year awards...&#34; Truer words were never spoken...Concerns over Hershel continue, and one of the best &#34;Made ya jump&#34; moments involves him and Lori.
They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem).
Nothing happens at all.Okay, we have went through what was wrong with the season, but now let me explain how this season still holds up and why it isn't as bad as you think it might be.In this season, we actually see a couple of characters, that we really like, get killed off  (I promise I won't reveal who).
The creepy locations where they find themselves often startles me, and watching Bobo, who is around 6'6" and I will not hazard a guess as to his weight, running around in the wilderness...to use his expression, that is as "squatchy" as you can get.PERSONAL NOTES: I have given kudos to Matt Moneymaker for speaking out against David Paulides, and if you read my reviews of Paulides' books you'll know why:Missing 411-Western United States & Canada: Unexplained Disappearances of North Americans that have never been solvedandMissing 411- Eastern United States: Unexplained disappearances of North Americans that have never been solved.However, my big hero is Ranae Holland, an out-and-proud lesbian who clearly misses her deceased father.
Director Roman Coppola and producer Youree Henley discuss the casting of the film, working on a short budget, crew members talk about production design and more.A Glimpse Into the Mind of Charles White III - (12:10) An interview with graphic artist Charles White III.EXTRAS:"Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:I watched a lot of cinema that may seem odd, abstract and while we expect to see these type of films coming from Europe and praise Fellini to even Jean-Luc Godard films for creating films that may not be comprehensive for the masses but yet intellectual and entertaining for those who are purveyors of unique, creative cinema...how are these films viewed if done today?Personally, watching "Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III", it's a film that you respect Roman Coppolla for attempting.
Shame on the voters who do this instead of considering an opinion, and shame on Amazon for expecting me to take my precious time to write a good review only to allow this type of shilling activity with the votes.GHOST MINE ~ general review which I'm putting under this particular episode, seasons 1 (2012) & 2 (2013) is yet another paranormal TV show I watch in order to relax and perhaps obtain a laugh or two.
But no, D&auml;niken's folksy immediate impression simply must be true, or else no ratings for History Channel...Indeed, it's precisely the populist style, pitting independent researcher against the scientific establishment, which explains part of D&auml;niken's appeal.
Also adding blood and guts for season three and more.All Kinds of Props - (5:32) Because there are more investigative scenes for season three, more props are used and this featurette goes into the props used for season three.Creating the World - (5:30) The crew that creates the world for "Body of Proof" and creating Philadelphia in Los Angeles and went into creating the episodes for season three.Body of Goofs  - (3:29) Featuring the burning down a house for an episode and what was involved in the creation of that scene.EXTRAS:"Body of Proof: The Complete Third Season" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:The final third season of "Body of Proof" was a season that would describe as action-packed, edgy and writers and cast putting it all on the line to see if this new direction will receive the green light for a fourth season.Unfortunately, Dana Delany has confirmed on Twitter that the show has been canceled, as fans who have supported the series have hoped that a new home on cable would be found.With that being said, my feeling of the third season is quite positive.
Now on the girls team, the one girl was doing well, I thought there were several other girls they could have let go, one of the girls who went up for elimination served &#34;RAW CHICKEN&#34; and she did not get sacked.
It also eventually leads to "The Flamingo" gaining control of the super car, but fortunately for the city all he cares about is revenge, otherwise the city would have been screwed, no thanks to our "heroes".The daughter uses the automated super car to cheat and pass her driver's exam.The son speculates about selling Grim Avenger tech on eBay for money.The son uses tattling about his sister's using the super car to pick up friends so that he can get out of trouble for skipping school.The father puts his children in danger by pursing criminals with them just to show them how important of a responsibility it is (even though it's the first time that he's bothered to do any crime fighting).In answering his last chance questions, the father makes it clear in his answers that his family comes first, no matter the cost to society and the city.
Whereas Hannibal is exquisitely dressed, utterly composed, with not a hair out of place, rarely if ever ruffled, like a pond that wouldn't ripple even if a boulder were thrown into it.Will lives in an old frame house with older and obviously lived in/used furniture with several dogs and lots of stuff; Hannibal, Jack Crawford, and Dr. DuMaurier and those colleagues whose homes or work places we're allowed to see all live and/or work in beautiful, well-ordered homes or offices with high end furnishings and decor, not a book out of place (even when there are so many, as in Hannibal's second level library, which I seriously envy).This illustrates perfectly the dichotomy with which most of us are constantly, if unconsciously, faced: the deceptiveness of perfect and beautiful surfaces, our instinctual attraction to and sympathy for symmetry and beauty, our instinctual suspicion and quick judgment of imperfect and asymmetrical people and things.The equating of beauty with normalcy/goodness and lack of beauty/imperfection with abnormalcy/suspicion is a constant subtext of this show.
I&#8217;m an adult and I was thrown by the visual similarities, NEW alien skin colors aside.I felt Arty&#8217;s character traits were a bit forced, as other devices, like his antenna sparkle ball (&#8220;I&#8217;m lit up&#8221;) and that a treasure box goes in and out of his head through a cone or a horn.
This is gonna get us fed to that octo-monster in the basement!-----Feldenbaum: I gotta tell ya, we don't step up our devastation and our enslavement numbers, the Galactic Overlord's going to [points to memo on clipboard] 'restructure our human resources'.Drebnor: What does that mean?Feldenbaum: Most of us are gonna get sucked through the airlock, but SOME of us will be fed to that weird alien, down in F sector.Drebnor: Not the one that looks like an octopus with fangs?Feldenbaum: Yeah.Drebnor: Ooooh, well, we don't want that!
With the new Alphas flooding in...the girl who rescued Isaac, and Cora, do we really need a gutsy new teach...Ms Blake, for Derek to (oddly, inexplicably) stalk/dally with (while looking that bored, Derek)?
Stark comes off like a wiener who uses people when he needs them, and then cuts them loose and sends them packing the second they're not needed.Captain America in this version is the most wishy-washy, no spine-having-est, oops-I-let-myself-get-shot-and-died-est, would-have-been-spanked-by-the-red-skull-and-left-for-dead-had-not-iron-man-blundered-into-the-frozen-tundra-and-saved-me-est, non-Avenger-est Avenger of all time... except for Falcon, of course.Hawkeye: Not as cool, tongue in cheek as I would imagine.
Anyway, Teresa hates her.There are other men and women besides the core group...we have extra sisters and brothers, parents and aunts and uncles, cousins, one idiot cousin in law and one gay one, and lots of frenemies, but aside from all having world-class heavyweight keisters, they don't count for much.
Also, even though so much of the plot is different from the book, I do find at least more than half of it compelling and suspenseful, such as the showdown between Big Jim and farmer Ollie Dinsmore, Big Jim's complex relationship with his son....actually, now that I think about it, just about all of the plotlines that focus on Big Jim, as Dean Norris is hands-down the best actor in this series.I'll be tuning in and hoping beyond hope that some positive changes are made when Season 2 premieres next summer, but right now, I'm worried that the writers will continue re-imagining so much of the story that they ruin it with droll like the Maxine character and subplot.
I like this actor, he is brilliantly in character, has an air of ragged desperation that is well shown, but he remains a man with a talent, a gift at seeing what is around him, what clues that other might miss.Sadly, the woman who died, Sienna, the interrogator, is the most compelling of the female team members.
But Walt's business did bring him a self-respect that he needed after the whole Gretchen & Elliot affair in season 1, where they offer to pay for his treatment under the guise of him coming to work for them at the company (that Walt helped found but never received any credit for).
I don't understand why people can't allow that to happen anymore... or why it's okay for Mad Men or Breaking Bad, but it's somehow not okay for The Bridge, or a German actress playing an El Paso detective, or whatever problem people have with the situation.Sonya Cross is a complex character, but I think Kruger has done an amazing job playing her; I would not change a thing.
These green lizard-bugs seem generic, and that feeling is exacerbated by the reuse of the same bad guy swarm attack over and over.Explain the red hulk/General Ross becoming a good guy to me.There are a lot of unexplained factors here, like how has the Hulk managed to gain so much control over himself?
UtraViolet purchased titles are in fact different from what's offered for sale on Amazon Digital.. You can download both for indefinite viewing, but Amazon's Digital contracts suggest instability issues..If I want to run the risk of movies disappearing on a whim, I'd still be with Netflix.. This film (Rewind) didn't really get into that either, though hinted at the topic.There's so many other things I want to banter on about, and while I wanted to love this movie for it's geekiness, history and delving into a world I'm so familiar with and love; I wanted to hear more stories from other true collectors and even strangers regarding their collecting and renting habits.. or even a mention of how Paramount first started renting their videos through Photo huts film kiosks where you'd get a catalog similar to the old Columbia House catalog and call and reserve a movie and then go pick it up..This is how I first saw Saturday Night Fever when I was 10... However,after viewing Rewind This twice (had to view it again to be fair, since I hated it the first time for being so touch and go), it just didn't hit a home run or even merit all of these good reviews.
They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem).
Maybe a "Dracula" marathon, watching all the Dracula movies ever made, will be in my future.One of the obvious limitations in making a movie like "Dracula" is that you are bound by constraints.
Jonathan loves Mina, who is the reincarnated wife of Dracula, who finds herself drawn to Alexander Grayson, who is busy seducing Lady Jane, who notices that Lucy is also in love with Mina, who encourages her to express her feelings as part of a roundabout plot to drive a wedge between Alexander and Mina after noticing their mutual attraction, who goes ahead with confessing her love to Mina, who when rebuffed, then sleeps with Jonathan in order to get back at Mina... oy.All these love triangle shenanigans take up a LOT of screen-time and very little of it makes sense.
It&#8217;s a no holds barred bloody knuckle brawl that should be celebrated by those who&#8217;ll love it most, which means telling most high-brow critics to go stuff themselves because they couldn&#8217;t possibly understand why it&#8217;s just so darn good.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me a DVD copy of RAZE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape or form influenced my opinion of it.
Secrets like Dr. Hatake's contacts, Dr. Hatake's album full of pictures, are running throughout the story.
They all shrugged their shoulders in a non-committal fashion and started hacking out the script for "THE AFTER".Putting aside the bong, they busted out the 20 sided die* they had from their Dungeons and Dragons game and made an alphabetic list of things that could cause an apocalypse that might be remotely entertaining, beginning with Aliens, and ending in Zombie-hybrids (leaving out E for "Ear Mites", I for "Indiana Jones Impersonators", L for "Leprechauns", P for "Preying Mantis", R for "Rascally Rabbits", and W for "Wascally Wabbits", much worse than the former).The only saving grace with the characters is that they were so fresh and original, no cobwebs to dust off these babies!
The mesh security gate is shut and there they are starving and thirsty (yeah, it's been fifteen minutes, but back off), succumbing to mysterious illnesses and being attacked for no apparent reason by armed escaped convicts.
G. Raff, "Your right Jo B. but I've been doing some fantastic exploring down here under the sea".Additionally the singing fish were quite fun and a novel twist on the plot.The MusicAs a professional film music artists, I can't underscore enough (ha) how will the music is done for this series.
I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country (including the president's son), ALL are on a bus... a &#34;normal&#34; field trip... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found... AND no security ON the bus... AND a crazy ex-FBI (or other 3-letter word agent) is on the bus with them.
While this is a cool setup for a start of a new series, the problems with this premise abound.Let us start out with the very initial part of the premise, the space stations.
Just as that movie ends with the seemingly invulnerable Anton Chigurrh falling prey to the vagaries and uncertainties of existence, badly injured in a random car crash, in Fargo we are introduced to a philosophical sociopath very similar to Chigurrh, Lorne Malvo, and that introduction also takes the form of a traffic mishap, as Malvo crashes his car trying to avoid a deer.
They want to live their life with the people they want to believe themselves to be.Three, people have neighbors that are driving them crazy, care nothing about their feelings and live a crazy life.I asked myself.
Watch and witness David Bradley's redemption and soak in subversive notions such as love as the catalyst to the downfall of humanity and that while a cane sword cannot slay the common cold, it might cut a swathe thru this strain.
