inspired the tv adaptation  by val mcdermid. the novel was very well written, and a nail biting suspense thriller. then i discovered that val mcdermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the tv crime drama wire in the blood.i finished watching all of season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by di carol jordan  hermione norris . she is assisted by clinical psychologist dr. tony hill  robson green , a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. his methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. both jordan and hill make a strange if compelling pair, with jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.unlike some of the  cozy  mysteries such as the long running midsomer murders   set one and the complete inspector lynley mysteries, wire in the blood is not for the faint of heart. the crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. the crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.the first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:the mermaids singing   hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.shadows rising   the skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, di jordan and hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark haired young women.justice painted blind   another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. a couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. this throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.the writing on this crime drama is excellent, and robson green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. the drama also explores the chemistry and tension between hill and di jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.the streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during episode one. there were no glitches

ten years, sunny is as the top of my list.  you need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  the first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of paddy  8217;s pub; owners dennis, mac, and charlie, and waitress dennis  8217;s twin sister dee.  in season 2  ten episodes , danny devito comes on board as frank, dennis and dee  8217;s dad.  the show  8217;s creators  rob mcelhenney  mac; glenn howerton dennis; and charlie day charlie  are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  it  8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that  8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  these first two seasons have some of my favorites, including   8220;charlie has cancer,  8221;   8220;charlie got molested,  8221;   8220;dennis and dee go on welfare,  8221;   8220;hundred dollar baby,  8221; and   8220;charlie goes america all over everybody  8217;s ass.  8221;  like most fans of the show, i tend to favor the charlie themed episodes, and considering that he  8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting snl, it  8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  but that  8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  i can  8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of dennis, dee, mac, and charlie, and even though frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  as far as current tv comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than   8220;always sunny,  8221; and these first

season is played in real time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day  would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must see season. in fact, this might be the best season of them all. the thrills and nail biting suspense  as well as the spoilers alert  begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of president palmer and assassination attempts on familiar ctu agents  one of which is tragically successful . jack bauer  kiefer sutherland  is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the white house. as he becomes the most wanted man in america  he is framed for palmer's assassination , he must try to ferret out the true culprit s  and again save the country from deadly russian extremists and various domestic villains. on a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  audrey raines  kim raver  might have moved on.there's a reason why kiefer won the best dramatic actor emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the west wing, the sopranos, grey's anatomy, and house for best drama. the fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting   from the gripping, edge of your seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no quarters given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of kiefer sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. kiefer is the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. he makes a scene work, even without dialogue. very good stuff. and, no, you do not want to get in the way of jack bauer.there are other standouts, of course. gregory itzin as the shifty and weak willed u.s. president makes you gleefully hiss, while jean smart as the medicated first lady martha logan brings earnest soap opera acting to primetime. mary lynn rajskub  chloe o'brian  continues her highlight role as ctu's brilliant but cantankerous and socially inept tech support operative. meanwhile, james morrison, roger cross, kim raver, carlos bernard, louis lombardi, and sean astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.that so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. there's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who

dvd box releases december 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next january on fox. season six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have james cromwell with a recurring role as jack's estranged dad, phillip bauer. also joining the cast is eddie izzard, kal penn  harold   kumar go to white castle , peter macnicol, regina king, and the beautiful rena sofer. i can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. long live jack bauer!", "reviewerID": "A2HVL790PBWYTU", "summary": "possibly the best 24 yet"}, {"reviewText": "revel in his awesomeness!!! for he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. the one time the emmys got something right!! jack bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co workers, his flagrant abuse of  prisoner's rights  and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is jack bauer, or more specifially, kiefer sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. when he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that sutherland brings to this show. also standing out as always is mary lynn rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked tongued chloe o'brien. the introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. but this season has some other stand out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. fans of the show know these as president charles logan  the wonderfully slimy gregory itzin  and his first lady martha logan  the amazing jean smart . their interplay and their performances are almost as key as sutherland in this season. another thing that came to be almost an in joke is that three members of the cast of the original robocop film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. julian sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil russian yet english accented terrorist. the premise is per usual: jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. but the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. the way it begins is almost as shocking as the way the season ends. and the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the united states and parts of canada and mexico... that was me. january 2007 cannot get here soon enough!!!", "reviewerID": "A2BFIYZYNK54QX", "summary": "jack bauer's hour of power towers over all!!!"}, {"reviewText": "the first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller escapism you'll find on television. it's fast paced, big budgeted, over the top  sometimes waaaaaaay over the top , and mostly clever. but i don't think any of the previous seasons  or the lame season 6  can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.yes this season follows the same  tired  gimick of everything happening in real time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot line. several of lead character jack bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. ok, sometimes the overall story arch does get side tracked to the typical  terrorists trying to release poisonous gas , and sometimes it's not always that interesting  ctu gets infiltrated again! . but none of these side attractions even begin to take away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break neck speed and crediblilty  thanks also to the believable performances of the entire cast .like some people i try not to watch the show on tv and much prefer to wait for the dvd to come out which is why i can't recommend buying this season enough  thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me . yes it's a couple years old now, but it's still the best  and most affordable  24 episodes of action you'll find

and it was well deserved.  even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  i am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  this season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.there were a couple flaws this season.  i sure don't remember the explanation of who knew jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  maybe it was mentioned and i missed it.  furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at ctu.  while it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.my biggest complaint this season was the body count.  we lost several key characters from previous years.  while i understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  it honestly got to the point i dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.  i'm counting down the hours until the next season premiers and we can start the rush all over again.", "reviewerID":

first 5 seasons  something of a marathon over the last month .season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. it starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.as to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold out packaging   outer sleeve, much like the highlander series and a few others. the first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases  the 4th holds the bonus features disc . a change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint  if not slightly smaller .season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. i might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu  looks like booting up and logging into a ctu computer system . however, on my dvd player i could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. so, it wasn't completely ungainly.the video and audio were up to par. of course i don't have a large screen wide screen tv nor surround sound, so i can't test under all conditions. but if there were any video or audio issues i didn't notice them. perhaps some moire color issues in scenes with close parallel line patterns. but i've noticed that on any number of dvd releases of other series from other studios, so i wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.overall, i highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy
