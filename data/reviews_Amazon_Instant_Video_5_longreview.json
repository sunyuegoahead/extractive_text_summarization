Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show's legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can't point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I'm a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn't mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black's real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I've long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black's Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season's opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha's father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I'm sure there was the temptation of a \"Big Ending,\" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn't the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn't the most ground breaking.  And it isn't likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used \"Science as Magic\" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A fun and dignified final season to Sci-fi longest continuously running series", "unixReviewTime": 1179360000, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2007"}, {"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B000ICRKLM", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [118, 166], "reviewText": "Warning!  There are multiple spoilers in the following review!I've watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I'm convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I'm not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they've been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett's leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I'm anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series' run.  If you don't have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal'c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.  But until we see how the new city in the air Atlantis works in terms of story and how the new cast changes affect the chemistry we won't know for sure.  One thing is for certain.  Season Four should bear little resemblance to any of the first three seasons.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good at times but overall fails to realize its potential", "unixReviewTime": 1183852800, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2007"}, {"reviewerID": "A2QDPJRVXL7P4F", "asin": "B000ICRKLM", "reviewerName": "Sahra Badou \"Bibliophile\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "This is by far the best season so far. I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn't she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he'd wear a uniform. Don't they ever get cold?4. Dr. Weir's (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn't an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There's so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn't.7. The episode \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren't Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space.

I've heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren't aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that's the case you're in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he's not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter's foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry's rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it's so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb's enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who's made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter's apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn't be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter's mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter's sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family's life crosses Dexter's life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He's impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it's discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid's of Dexter's past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what's driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of \"24\", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn't let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you're not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I'm already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about.

They also set out in making a point about the whole showing an image of the Prophet Muhammad on national TV, they set out in making a point about freedom of expression and not allowing terror threats to scare them. Did they win that war? You'll have to watch this season to find out.Episode 1: The Return of Chef: In this episode we see Chef return to South Park after a time with the Super Adventure Club who we later learn that they are a group of explorers that show a special interest in the children of remote tribes. The boys have to cope with this change in Chef and the influence that the Super Adventure Club had on him. In reality this is the episode where we say goodbye to Chef for good, as in season 9 South Park had an episode called Trapped in the Closet which made fun of the \"Religion\" of Scientology. Isaac Hayes who was the voice of Chef is a Scientologist, he seemed to hold a double standard when making fun of religion. It's OK to make fun of Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism etc but as long as you don't make fun of Scientology it's OK but if you do then Hayes said goodbye to South Park. This is an amazing episode and is really enjoyable listening to Chef speak as it's chopped together dialogue from previous episodes.Episode 2: Smug Alert: \"I know, for this episode let's make fun of those people who drive environmentally friendly cars and suddenly think they're better than everybody else.\" This is what Stone & Parker would have thought when coming up with the idea for this episode as they do just that. They pick up on the smugness of these people and tear them apart which is a very intelligent move by the creators. The story is simple; Gerald, Kyles dad is now the owner of a hybrid car and he suddenly feels it's his duty to insult those who have gas gusler cars. Gerald moves the family to San Francisco where everybody drives a Hybrid, but Stan being upset with this decides to write a song that will encourage more people to buy Hybrids which should get Kyle to come back home. This is a great episode with a great message about those people who to drive the hybrid cars, it takes the subject and says to those people \"I know you drive them, and I don't care.\"Episode 3 & 4: Cartoon Wars Part 1 & 2: This is an episode that stirred up a lot of controversy as these two episodes were based around the whole image of Muhammad hysteria that was surrounding the media at the time. Stone & Parker had made the episodes with the clear intention of Comedy Central showing the image on TV and setting an example about freedom of speech but unfortunately it wasn't to be. The story of the episodes are that Family Guy are set to show an image of Muhammad in one of their episodes; Cartman being utterly offended by this sets out to put an end to Family Guy once and for all but he has one obstacle; Kyle. These are a great set of episodes that just rip Family Guy to pieces when talking about their comedy, the whole notion of Family Guy being written my Manatees is brilliant and when you really give it some thought you start to think to yourself, \"Well maybe this is possible.\"Episode 5: A Million Little Fibers: This is by far the weakest episode of the bunch as it's an episode focusing directly on Towelie. He decides to write a book about his life but everything keeps going wrong and he can't get his book published because he's a towel. He assumes a human personality and changes his book around which becomes an instant success and Oprah Winfrey wants to put her name on this book. This is really one of the weakest episodes out of them all and I think was just a filler to get to the next great idea.Episode 6: Manbearpig: This is the typical insult episode that rips apart Al Gore over the movie he made called an Inconvenient Truth, it makes fun of the whole \"Look at me I'm an ex-president trying to keep the limelight\" that seems to surround Al Gore. He has a new theory in South Park and that's a monster that will be a danger to everyone, Manbearpig. Half man, half bear and half pig, he can't prove it but he's super serial.Episode 7: Tsst: I honestly don't think I've ever laughed so much at a South Park episode, Cesar Milan of the Dog Whisperer fame is called in to take control of Cartman and his bad behaviour. Using some techniques that would only usually be performed on Dogs, Cartman isn't happy about being humiliated and resorts to making some drastic plans for revenge.Episode 8: Make Love, Not Warcraft: Everybody has them, everybody has that one friend who would quite openly admit that they would rather spend the day on World of Warcraft than go outside and play. Parker and Stone set out to make fun of these kids and show them that they need to get out more, some people may find it harsh but some people like myself would find it utterly hysterical.Episode 9: Mystery of the Urinal Deuce: The world's biggest conspiracy of all time will finally be uncovered when Eric Cartman exposes the true culprit behind the September 11th attacks. How will that person prove his innocence and who really was behind 9/11. This is a funny episode that gives a big slap in the face of the conspiracy theorists, I can't help but think that Parker and Stone wanted to give their opinions on the subject in this episode rather than just be intelligent about it.Episode 10: Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy: Eric Cartman is selected to become South Park elementary schools hall monitor, so he dons the look of a bounty hunter and sets out to clean up the halls. He accidentally stumbles upon a teacher in a relationship with a student and wants to put a stop to it. A very good episode with some strong home truths.Episode 11: Hell On Earth 2006: Satan is throwing the biggest Halloween costume party ever, and no one will be admitted without a wristband. Every detail must be perfect for the prince of darkness. But even Satan can't foresee everything. A prominent religious organization, an ex-lover and the antics of the most notorious serial killers of all time threaten Satan's fun. A complete slaughtering of the my Super Sweet 16 girls which I personally feel was long overdue from the South Park guys.Episode 12: Go God Go Part 1: South Park Elementary faces strong opposition to the topic of evolution being taught to the 4th graders. The most vocal protests are from Ms. Garrison who has to teach it. Eric Cartman can't be bothered with what's going on in class. He's busy manipulating his own personal time-line to align with the precise release date of the Nintendo Wii. A great satirical episode that this time doesn't poke fun at the notion of religion but pokes fun at a world without religion, would we all really get along like Richard Dawkins says we would?Episode 13: Go God Go Part 2: Last week Eric Cartman froze himself in an attempt to make his three-week wait for a hot, new, gaming device pass quickly. A freak accident landed him over 500 years in the future and now he's stuck there. The future is a tumultuous place with warring factions, angry sea otters and no Nintendo. Will Cartman find a way back to his own time? A humorous look on a future without religion, how would we find a way to keep fighting if we don't have the excuse of religion.Episode 14: Stanley's Cup: Stan Marsh has hit rock bottom. He's got no job, no bicycle and his only way out of a bad situation, is to coach the local pee wee hockey team. Once a hotshot pee wee hockey player himself, Stan Marsh has tried to put those days behind him.

The social/political satire is still as strong as ever but the episodes are stretching more to make their points.  Instead of being absurdly funny and clever, some of these episodes are just absurd and go out of their way to say, \"Look at me, look how shocking I am\" (\"The Return of Chef,\" \"Smug Alert!,\" \"A Million Little Fibers,\" \"Stanley's Cup\").  Still, this season offers what I believe is the greatest SP episode of all-time and maybe the best thing I have ever seen on television: \"Make Love Not Warcraft.\"  This episode is so well-done in animation (yes, excellent SP animation) and story-writing that I cannot praise it enough.  Plus, it includes music from one of my favorite singers ever: Paul Stanley!  Then there are the excellent two-parters when Cartman goes to the future (Mrs. Garrison and that scholar guy are hilarious!) and  \"Cartoon Wars\" where SP takes on Family Guy with references to other animated shows. \"Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy\" takes the female teacher/boy student love affair controversy to a level only SP can. The positives outweight the negatives here but it's not perfect, so I can't give it 5 stars no matter how much I love the World of Warcraft episode. The cover of the box (Target edition) is awesome.  You see the SP boys fat and pimply and, by tilting the box, you see their World of Warcraft characters.Disc 1:\"The Return of Chef\"--Controversial episode that got back at Isaac Hayes for leaving SP when it tackled the Scientology issue. Hearing old Chef audio clips, the SP boys notice something has changed drastically in Chef after his return from an adventure with a mysterious club.  Yikes!\"Smug Alert!\"--People of SP start buying hybrid cars and find out they're threatening the planet with emissions of another kind.  The beginning of this episode with Gerald acting all high and mighty in his hybrid was great.  I thought it was going to be another excellent episode.  At the point where the forest ranger explains what's going on to Stan, things went downhill.  Here, the episode tried a little too hard to make a statement.  It is very contrived.\"Cartoon Wars Part 1\"--Fear engulfs SP when a Family Guy episode showing an image of Mohammad threatens holy war.  While the nation buries its head in the sand (literally), Cartman goes on a mission to cancel Family Guy and Kyle tries to stop him.\"Cartoon Wars Part 2\"--Pre-empted for a Terrance and Phillip television special...just kidding.  Cartman finds out something shocking about the writers of Family Guy.  I'll admit that show makes a lot more sense now.  The Muslims' retaliation was going in the right direction but ended up going the way of \"The Passion of the Jew\" which is unfortunate because it became stupid instead of funny.\"A Million Little Fibers\"--Towlie promotes his memoirs but hits a snatch...er...snag when he lies to Oprah Winfrey.  This episode is way over-the-top for my tastes and is not re-watchable.Disc 2:\"Manbearpig\"--Al Gore is super serial about a new threat to the planet.  Can the man who invented the Internet save the earth from the vicious Manbearpig? Wait...isn't manbearpig an endangered species?\"Tsst\"--Mrs. Cartman has had it with her out-of-control son but, after failing on several nanny reality shows, has to resort to hiring a dog trainer.  One of the better episodes of this season.\"Make Love Not Warcraft\"--The best thing I've seen on TV, period.  Brilliant! It's interesting that here is one of the few times Cartman is a good leader who isn't a jerk to everyone...except Butters, of course.\"The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\"--An unwelcomed sight in the boy's room somehow leads to the unlocking of a 9/11 conspiracy.  We get to meet the Hardly Boys who seem to be hardly ever not hard.  The funniest part of this episode is how Mr. Mackey keeps hounding on finding more than a cake in the urinal.\"Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy\"--A teacher at SP Elementary is having an affair with a student...a very young student.  Meanwhile, Cartman gets some real \"authoritie\" as a hallway monitor and treats his job as if he is a certain television bounty hunter.  His assistant Beth with the big knockers is hilarious.Disc 3:\"Hell On Earth 2006\"--Satan wants a Halloween party just like the Super Sweet 16 parties those snotty rich girls on MTV get.  Meanwhile, the folks of SP keep summoning Biggie Smalls back to earth.  A ho-hum episode. The Three Stooges take-off with Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacey doesn't do it for me. It just doesn't make sense as Bundy would never hang out with those guys.  Plus, Gacey would want to kill children, not adults and Dahmer would be killing young, dark-skinned men.\"Go God Go\"--Mrs. Garrison is against teaching her class evolution until a handsome atheist scholar is hired to teach her class.  Meanwhile, Cartman can't wait for the release of the Nintendo Wii so he has himself frozen but his defrost took longer than he anticipated.  Tears came to my eyes when Mrs. Garrison described evolution to the class I was laughing so hard.\"Go God Go XII\"--Cartman is stuck in the future where there is no religion and, therefore, no war...yeah right!  I like how they say \"science\" in their slurs instead of \"God\" or \"JC.\" When Cartman calls himself in the past it is hilarious!  He finally gets to encounter his awful self but, of course, doesn't learn anything from it.\"Stanley's Cup\"--To get his bike out of impound, Stan coaches a peewee hockey team that includes a player dying of cancer.

At the same time Dean is dying and his father exchanges his own life for Dean's but yet gives Dean the mission to look after Sam and save him, or kill him if he can't protect and save him. It ends with Dean doing the same bargaining as his father for the life of Sam who was killed in the dead western city of Cold Oak. Dean manages to get one year of living before he is reclaimed.This second season tells us too a little more about the demons. Apart from the everyday black-eyed demons who are tortured souls that stopped being human and became demons, there is a particular and more powerful one, the yellow-eyed demon, and though we are not told what or who he really is, he is what we can call a higher class demon. He is the one who accepted to take John's life in the place of Dean's. He is the one who has chosen Sam for a special mission that will be uncovered during this second season. What is that mission?Strangely enough all the hunting is for that yellow-eyed demon nothing but training for Sam and the training is not only directed at Sam. This second season is focusing on the hunting by the two brothers of the yellow-eyed demon. But, this seems to be part of a plan elaborated by him to train Sam and make him understand his importance and his uniqueness. With others like him, that are called \"psychic\" in the series, they have been selected by this special demon to accomplish a task, that is to say lead the demonic army that is to break loose from Hell. Of these \"psychic\", Sam will meet four of them, but there are more, all born on the same year 1983, and whose mothers all died in a nursery fire. We come across them now and then but they do not seem to be very resilient. In a final attempt at selecting the right \"general\" to bring in the armies of Hell out of the deep,he brings together four psychic and a black veteran from Afghanistan (who also has special abilities in a dead western city, Cold Oak in South Dakota, for the sole survivor to accomplish the mission.The Black chap, Jake, will manage, under blackmail from the yellow-eyed monster and menaces against his mother and sister, to kill Sam by cutting his spine through. He is an obviously well trained GI. But Dean will manage to revive Sam by a trip to Crossroads Inn, Mississippi to meet with a crossroad demon, that grants wishes that was tracked down in a previous episode, and to bargain his life against Sam's. He will get a one year survival time for himself. But that enables the two brothers to go to Bobby who had noticed that evil and demonic elements were concentrating around a special zone in Wyoming.Sam will actually find out that in this sector there is a cemetery and a crypt in the center, built by Samuel Colt surrounded by churches connected by railroads building up a pentacle or pentagram, which is called in the series a \"devil's trap\", that can imprison demons if they enter it. The crypt in the cemetery is supposed to be the gate to hell, the gateway through which the armies of Hell will invade the earth. This is an important specification in the series. Several episodes are openly dedicated to Catholic beliefs: angels for one, but also a Catholic priest in a Catholic church who is shot dead on the steps to his church and cannot receive the last rites. He becomes a haunting ghost and is redeemed by the priest of the church.This leads to a discussion that emerges several times on the existence of angels. Dean does not believe. Sam does believe. This definitely gives the series a Christian if not Catholic ring, especially with the number of times the Catholic exorcizing rite or ritual chant is used, though it is never uttered by a priest in the series, which makes it surprisingly iconoclastic. Never people believing in exorcism would consider a lay man could perform the rite. It is the same thing with the use of holy water. For example when Ellen, the inn-keeping lady of the roadside diner that is a meeting place for spirit hunters, comes at the end of the season for help after her diner and everyone in it were burnt to ashes, she is asked to drink a glass of holy water to make sure she is not possessed. This is definitely Catholic, but at the same time always performed by non-believers or even atheists. This is a reference to a religion from the point of view of people who are totally unconcerned by it as if you may not believe in God but God believes in you. Does he?The special gun John Winchester had saved and kept for its final task and that he had traded with the yellow-eyed demon for Dean's life and that still had one special bullet, was in fact the key to the door of the crypt that enables the armies of hell to come into this world. But the weapon only and not the bullet. The gun was recuperated, too late, by the Winchesters and the bullet killed the yellow-eyed demon, or can we be sure it did?That's when the tale turned ironical and sour. The poor Jake who had accepted, willy nilly and more nilly than willy, to be the servant of the demon did manage to open the gate and thus to enable the yellow-eyed demon to enter the final pentacle, but he was shot on the spot by the Winchesters. He probably died smiling since he thus saved his mother and his sister. But he got nothing out of the deal at all. That's the irony of those devilish missions: the possessed do what they are supposed to do, and at times it takes a lot of energy from the demon to convince them. Like in this special case, where Jack has a mission that a demon or a possessed human could not accomplish since they could not enter the pentacle, but otherwise demons only take possession of human bodies and use them as \"meat suits\"But this second season has a touch of itself first of all in the constant debate about the worthiness of the fight, the worthiness of one brother being ready to die for the other and vice versa (if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself.) This debate is constant, deep in many ways and perfectly well acted for us to believe that what is mostly a verbal claim no one ever makes true is probably true for these two brothers. That the father accepts to die in the place of his sons is normal since his sons are his heirs, his continuation into eternal human life. But for two brothers it is surprising especially since in our common vision of two brothers, even twins, and these are no twins, there is always some amount of hostility when it is not hatred and jealousy, which is indeed present in these two brothers. That can be explained by the fact they grew up apart from the world, taking care of each other while their father was hunting this yellow-eyed demon that killed his wife/their mother. Also, the animosity would rather be localized between Sam and John, Dean being the lever, the path between these two characters that have antagonistic trajectories.Those two brothers are so much in love with one another that they are ready to sacrifice their whole life for an adventure together. This is not inhuman. This is superhuman. This is an idealistic vision and the actors make us believe it is true, possible. That level of intimacy between two brothers is admirable and beautiful, even if, deep behind my mind's eye I kind of doubt it a little bit.There is a last remark I want to make on this season. The South was finally represented this year with Mississippi, but in a rather unfavorable light as a place of demons, curses and other devilish traffics. Yet Mississippi is the place where the resurrection of Sam is purchased. We are no longer dealing with anything Christian here but with something like voodoo, the originally African religion of the Blacks in the South that has survived in spite of all the Christianizing performed by the whites over the centuries.But this leads to the plain fact that all black characters are evil in a way or another, either because they are easily manipulated by some demon or evil mind, or because they are sort of genetically evil, even Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is shown as unable to see beyond his book of rules, and who is turned upside down and made a fool of by the two Winchester brothers and their female and not so much experienced lawyer. And fooled is a euphemism: he turns out to be a plain dummie. But the FBI agent will remain on the tracks of course because he is a Fox Beyond and you may choose, Insanity, Intelligence, Intuition or Impotence.We could say that they are doing wrong while hoping to do good : nave would be a better word to describe them. Jack is hoping to save the ones he loves, but doesn't understand that the whole planet will die, while the Winchesters brothers are willing to die for the sake of humanity. The FBI agent is not trying to understand what is going on but wants to catch two fugitives that are threats to his un-supernatural world, where a ghost belongs in a book. He is too rational to understand, maybe to good at what he does to think outside his pragmatic, Cartesian referential mind. And he lacks the creativity or the beliefs that what is really and what he sees are two different things.The season ends well since it has finally redeemed the father and created a tremendous suspense as for the future since in twelve months Dean will die. That's not much time with all the evil spirits that have been released from hell.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Black is fate without light", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2011"}, {"reviewerID": "A2HVL790PBWYTU", "asin": "B000MVN8GK", "reviewerName": "H.

All your worldly possessions. Where are you from? Brigadoon?\"Nope, Neptune in Cali isn't exactly as  magical as Brigadoon. Neptune, like most places, hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents, which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency, staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19-year-old daughter Veronica. So for this 3rd and final season, we again say hello - and bid farewell - to these folks up in Neptune. With high school flush in her rearview mirror, part-time shamus, now full-time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College. But some things simply don't change for our feisty heroine. She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend, Logan Echolls. And she still touts a rep for ferreting out, and digging in, and nosing about. And, since she does get results, she's soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.Some plot SPOILERS follow.VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good, but it's the weakest of the three seasons. This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder. On a smaller scale, her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook, some missing tapes, an accusation of plagiarism, a vanished heiress, a secret society, a holdup at a costume casino party, etc. So add that to her freshman woes. And, being Veronica Mars, she also doesn't take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity, as well as the weasely assistant of her criminology professor. But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper. And she's always got her buds to lean on, Wallace, Mac, and Logan, even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic (just one reason this season isn't as good).But the show's not all about Veronica (it's just mostly about Veronica). My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars, and he has his own messes to muddle thru. Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations; Weevil is now out on parole (from his misdeeds in Season 2) but must maintain a job; and Mac, well, she's still shy. Meanwhile, Veronica's clique widens in the forms of the happy-go-lucky, kinda dull Piz (Wallace's roomie) and party girl, kinda dull Parker (Mac's roomie). So, hello, new loves and old loves, and there's even a hasty wedding. As usual, it's a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises. Just life in Neptune.SPOILERS end.So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes (plus extras) in one sleep-deprived - but worth it - marathon viewing session. Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television, the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more. Having said that, not only am I bummed out about the series's abrupt demise but pretty upset that there wasn't even a proper ending to the series. Again, only 20 episodes here, with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff. Not cool, CW.Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff, which can be found on the 6th disc (there are 6 discs in all in this set). Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4: one's a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would've been like (Veronica in the FBI), the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica's father and circle of friends) had been taken away. A whole new mess of characters are introduced, all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.Under the banner \"Going Undercover with Rob Thomas\" (and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge) we get 9 ho-hum featurettes: \"Main Titles: Why the Change?\"; \"Rob's Directing Experience\"; \"Favorite Guest Star Moments\"; \"Veronica Mars: Mean Girl\" - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; \"The Politics of Veronica Mars\" - concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his \"Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments\" and his \"Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments\"; \"Do-Overs?\" - scenes of which Thomas wasn't too fond; and \"Highlights\" - more of Thomas's fave moments. Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas's intros; a 7 minute gag reel (best was Enrico Colantoni's many takes of \"I finally got the police report on the ****'s suicide\"). The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips, the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q & A-ing each other. There's also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes. A ton of extras here, so I shouldn't gripe; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods, consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny, with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist. Once in a while, my thoughts were even provoked. Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter, the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi-faceted mysteries which perplexed. But by this season's end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern, that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline. The last five episodes instead tended to be self-contained ones, and that's when the show really began to feel fractured. There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons, although most of the episodes are still darn watchable. If I had to pick favorites, three episodes instantly spring to mind: \"Debasement Tapes,\" in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled, near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory; \"Postgame Mortem,\" in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11-year-old girl; and episode 20, which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.In the acting department, Jason Dohring (the ever moody Logan) again stands out. Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe. My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter-dad thing. There's just this amazing level of understanding, caring, and humor between them, and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni. Whenever they're in a scene together, the world is good. And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.But, well, the show's done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it's still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: \"A long time ago, we used to be friends.\" VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show.

Spoilers littered throughout this review!Note:  I'll rewrite the following paragraph soon (pressing matters keeps me from doing more right now) but we now know from reliable sources that Veronica is not going to be back in any way.  She will not be back as a college student and she will not be back as an FBI agent in a reworked format.  The only reason the CW hasn't already made the announcement, according to Kristin of Eonline.com, is that they are afraid of the anger fans will heap on them.  They will deserve that anger!  For me the CW will always be the network that made room for a mother-daughter beauty pageant, a second season of the Pussycat Doll show, and THE FARMER TAKES A WIFE.  It had room for absolutely miserable excuses for shows like these, but couldn't find room on its schedule for VERONICA MARS.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the CW.I will revise this first paragraph as soon as we know for certain, but it is not true, as has been almost universally reported, that VERONICA MARS has been cancelled.  As of today this is what we know for certain:  it has not yet been placed on the fall schedule.  The head of the CW, Dawn Ostroff, says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone, she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project, which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS, in which the plot would shoot to the future, to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent.  This would be accompanied with a completely new supporting cast and perhaps even a title change in the show.  Numerous sources have reported and Dawn Ostroff herself has stated that she has until June 15, 2007 to make a decision on whether to pick this new series up.  To be honest, not many insiders are offering fans much hope that this series will be picked up.  But as the old expression goes, \"The opera ain't over until the fat lady sings.\"  Well, she isn't singing yet, but she might be warming up.  We'll have to keep our fingers crossed that the next three weeks will bring some good news.Certainly we need not fear for the long term future of Kristen Bell.  One of the most talented actresses on TV, she is not only lovely but a gifted actress, singer, and dancer all in one diminutive package.  The question is not whether she will be involved in some project in the future, but which one.  Most immediately it appears that she will be the narrator for GOSSIP GIRL (this might not happen if she plays VERONICA MARS in some way, but even if she does, it might be possible for her to serve as narrator--she did do the narration for the pilot that critics saw at the Upfront in New York).If VERONICA MARS is cancelled and we see no more of our pint-sized but large-spirited teen detective, we can, in a way, be grateful that we got three full seasons.  I fell in love with this show immediately and watched it religiously through its entire run.  When UPN inexplicably scheduled it opposite one of my other favorite shows, LOST, I recorded LOST and watched VERONICA MARS live.  Veronica was when she debuted the latest in a string of strong female characters to have arisen in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER making TV safe for such creatures.  She was, in fact, the heroine who most resembled Buffy.  The first two seasons were simply glorious, two utterly perfect seasons that topped almost everything else on television.  Season Three, unfortunately, represented something of a slip for the show.  (I refuse it give it less than five stars, however, simply because it was still better than most else on television.)  Many people have felt this and have speculated on why.  My own belief is that VERONICA MARS suffered from network interference.  Both Season One and Season Two were driven by deep emotional needs in Veronica to solve major mysteries.  Season Three had no such deep mystery (though there were two lesser ones) and as a result lacked the emotional intensity of the previous seasons.  No doubt a lot of this was the result of the network putting pressure on the show to make it accessible to new viewers.  We've seen this take place again and again over the years with various shows and the brute fact is:  it doesn't work.  Mainly such an approach wins no new viewers and alienates many of the viewers the show already has.  I spent all of Season Three with a mild feeling of disappointment, yearning for the intensity to return.  Yet, sometimes it did.  \"Spit and Eggs,\" which resolved the campus rape mystery, was as stressful and as wonderful as the best Season One and Two episodes, but it turned out to be the exception and the rules.My own thinking on the \"how to win new fans\" issue with series is that watering down the show never works.  Instead, I think the way to go is to rely on online streaming and DVD to get potential fans caught up.  I didn't, for instance, start watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS last fall when it debuted.  But I was able to catch up by watching it on NBC.com.  The CW put up a few episodes for streaming, but only a few.  What they needed to do was place the entire season online for its shows, much like NBC does.  Serial dramas like VERONICA MARS can attract and build up a fanatically devoted fanbase, but you keep that fanbase by continuing to produce a high quality serial drama, not by forcing it to become more and more episodic.  The truth is that networks almost always complicate rather than improve a series through their meddling.Another perplexing problem with Season Three was the near disappearance of several supporting characters.  At times I wondered if Wallace was still part of the show.  And Weevil played less and less of a role as the season went along.  My understanding is that Francis Capra, who plays Weevil, had some health problems during the season (and that medication he was taking led to a rather startling weight gain early in the year with accompanying skin problems--these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end).  Mac became an opening credits character, but she didn't seem to play any more important role than she had in the past.Still, some things remained really great about the show.  Veronica and her father continued to have one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying, father-daughter relationship on TV.  Veronica continued to impress and overwhelm all those disposed to doubt her.  And as a huge BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan she made the best frakkin' BSG references on all TV (though Dwight Schruette of THE OFFICE and Seth Cohen of THE O.C. gave her a run for her money), even helping one client find a woman she met at the BSG session at Comicon.  But a lot of the passion of the previous years was gone.  TV critics noticed.  For its first two seasons, VERONICA MARS was probably one of the five most critically praised shows on TV.  In Season Three it probably dropped out of the top ten to somewhere in the 10-15 spot.  I blame this entirely on network interference.The most heartbreaking part of the season came with the finale, which left several plot lines unresolved.  This was not entirely the network's fault.  Rob Thomas obstinately refused to do a \"just in case\" ending for the season.  He apparently wanted to increase the pressure on the network to renew the show.  That is one philosophy, but I prefer Joss Whedon's when he was on BUFFY.  His idea was that you never knew whether you would get cancelled (fortunately BUFFY never did, though both ANGEL and FIREFLY would be), so you leave the end of each season in a place where it could both lead into something if you get renewed, but it would be satisfying to the fans if you don't.  EVERWOOD filmed two versions of its Season Three finale in case it didn't get renewed.  It didn't, but thankfully a finale existed that wrapped up the show  Now, unless the FBI Agent Veronica Mars series materializes, we are left with a dangling show.  Moreover, it will dangle most likely regardless, since a time shift to several years in the future will take the show well past the subsequent events on the show.  Networks should do a better job of ending serial drams with dedicated fanbases, but the executive producers need to take some responsibility as well.  I can understand Rob Thomas's reluctance to not go gentle into that good night, but I wish he had filmed an episode that did a better job of wrapping up the series.  As it is, we are left wondering whether the homicidal nutjob Logan beat up got his revenge, whether Jake Kane was once again a part of the show's story, and whether Vinnie Van Low was the new sheriff of Neptune.Television is going to miss this show.  Although NBC debuts THE BIONIC WOMAN in the fall of 2007 (with a crackerjack production staff, a strong cast, and some very good writers, making this look like a more like one of the more promising series of 2007-2008), television is lacking somewhat right now in strong female characters.  In fact, only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with characters like Laura Roslin, Sharon Agathon, and Starbuck has much in the way of strong women.

Just when it seems SP has reached its peak, it keeps coming up with creative shows that cover the latest fads in our popular culture and sociopolitical consciousness.  Although \"Make Love Not Warfare\" from season 10 is still my favorite episode, season 11 provides another solid crop of classics, from the openings of \"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\" and \"D-Yikes\" to the conclusions of \"Imaginationland, Episode III\" and \"The Night of the Living Homeless.\"Disc 1:\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\"--Who can ever forget Randy Marsh's faux pas on \"Wheel of Fortune,\" the way he apologized to Jesse \"the emperor of black people\" Jackson, and his fight to ban a hateful slur from society with the help of Michael Richards and Mark Fuhrman?  Meanwhile, a midget author who speaks at the school provides amusement for Cartman and an epiphany for Stan.  Instant classic.\"Cartman Sucks\"--There are several peculiar incidences in this season that put into question Cartman's sexuality.  This episode is one of them.  Cartman takes a picture with a certain body part of a sleeping Butters in his mouth.  When Cartman learns what such a photo means, he tries to take another photo with Butters to reverse it, but Butters's dad walks in on them and sends his son to bi-curious camp.  Of course, SP fans know Butters's dad has some bi-curious issues of his own.  Meanwhile, Cartman must make sure the offensive photos does not get out.\"Lice Capades\"--It is revealed that someone in Mrs. Garrison's class has head lice and the students turn vicious with suspicion.  Of course, SP can't just scratch the surface; if you will, it needs to dig deeper by covering a louse community destroyed by the shampoo treatment.  A lot of movie references in this one.\"The Snuke\"--A new student arrives in class who is a Muslim and immediately sparks Cartman's suspicions.  Turns out there is a terrorist attack planned, but not by Muslims--and it involves Hillary Clinton's unmentionable.  Clinton's voice makes her sound like a down home southern gal, not a Senator from New York.  I like how so much information can be found on the Internet and the blinking 12:00 on the \"24\" clock after the power goes out.\"Fantastic Easter Special\"--Stan questions what easter eggs and bunnies have to do with Christ's resurrection and learns about the secret \"Hare Club For Men\" (where do they come up with this stuff?) A Da Vinci Code style mystery is unveiled and Matt and Trey get back at the head of the American Catholic League who had been critical of SP and said some anti-Semitic things in the past.  Hmmmm, the papal mitre does look like it belongs on a rabbit.  \"Hippitus, hoppitus,\" indeed.Disc 2:\"D-Yikes\"--I love the opening to this one!  I remember when it was first aired I struggled to stop laughing after Mrs. Garrison storms into the classroom complaining about men.  This episode is one of the funniest SPs ever.  I like when Garrison announces she's gay and Stan replies, \"Again?\"  And the name of the lesbian bar is great!  I've never seen the movie \"300,\" but it's a takeoff on that.\"The Night Of The Living Homeless\"--SP is suddenly overrun with homeless people begging for change.  When the boys learn to mystery behind the onslaught of beggars, can they, with the help of some old school NWA & The Posse 8-Ball \"City of Compton\" style rap, save the day?Le Petit Tourette\"--Cartman sees a kid cussing uncontrollably in a toy store and learns that the kid has Tourette's Syndrome (is this a subject right up SP's alley, or what?!).  Cartman is given an idea that makes him so happy he breaks out in song.  Of course, his plan backfires when he starts blurting out things that, to him, are more damaging and offensive than \"%#@& #$!!*() #%!($#@@&/.\"\"More Crap\"--Randy Marsh passes a world record size BM.  when his record is broken, his life's quest is to get it back--but Bono is bound (if you will) to stop him.  I actually agree with the point they make about Bono, but this episode has a very nasty part--and I'm not talking about the BMs.Disc 3:\"Imaginationland\"--OK, the bet Cartman made with Kyle is hilarious.  I laughed to tears when I first saw it on TV, but what does it say about Cartman's sexuality?  Is that a prize a straight guy would want?  I mean, another guy performing the task?  What's up with that?  Anyway, the boys go on a trip to a land of imaginary characters--including my favorite, Pac-Man, though I don't like that he's sometimes given teeth--and it's hit with a terrorist attack.  Yes, terrorists have now attacked our imaginations.  Meanwhile, Cartman takes Kyle to court and Stan and Kyle are taken to the Pentagon for questioning.\"Imaginationland, Episode II\"--That opening dream sequence is from Monty Python.  The terrorists break down a wall and unleash the evil characters of our imagination and now imaginations are really running wild, especially when Cartman's demented Christmas woodland critters show up.  Stan and Kyle help the feds break through the portal to Imaginationland but, just before the troops charge in, Kyle may finally have to pay his debt to Cartman.\"Imaginationland, Episode III\"--With the help of Butters, the good imaginary characters set out to battle the evil ones.  Kyle has to stop the Pentagon from destroying Imaginationland before the good characters have a chance to win.  Al Gore, however, might doom everyone when he sees the evil character from his imagination.  Oh, and the Cartman/Kyle bet finally gets settled...sort of.\"Guitar Queer-o\"--Great!  In typical SP fashion, the importance of Guitar Hero is built up all out of proportion.  This episode shows how Matt and Trey keep up with the fads of pop culture.  I also like this episode because I'm a Kansas fan.\"The List\"--There's a list the girls created ranking the boys in their class from cutest to ugliest and Kyle is ranked last.  That can't be right!  Kyle is adorable!

Bala \"Me Too Can Read\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I know it, this is a friggin' looong read. The short version: I like JERICHO, and I recommend it. Now, here's the long version.SPOILERS, here and there, everywhere.Great, something nutty survivalists and I can agree on. So I really like JERICHO. It's a strong show and addictive, with a tantalizing premise that should geek out almost any casual fan. Today, end-of-the-world stories have become even more fascinating and timely. JERICHO nicely slides into that space, dropping a tale of fear and struggle and of survival and hope. JERICHO tells of frightened townspeople pulling together under duress and facing down each daunting obstacle. As it turns out, JERICHO is also about nuts. There's a memorable scene late in Season One regarding nuts, and even a real life, save-the-show campaign involving nuts.The story begins with residents of small town Jericho, Kansas glimpsing a shocking mushroom cloud blooming, off in the distance. Word rapidly gets out that Denver and Atlanta have become the targets of nuclear attacks, and who knows how many other cities were bombed? Very shortly after, Jericho, population five thousand, finds itself alarmingly cut off, with minimal and dubious contact with the outside world. In the following days and weeks, the town finds itself contending with a plague of challenges, from radioactive fallout to widespread paranoia to roving marauders to the inevitable arrival of shellshocked refugees from affected neighboring towns and cities. All too soon, the town's resources begin to peter out. Just how long can Jericho and its people hang on, before it all falls apart?The collapse of civilization has a way of leaving deep psychological scars. When stripped of the underpinnings of society and government, it's awfully hard not to become reduced to a caveman denominator. Jericho, influenced by its mayor and his sons, tries to cling to its pre-apocalyptic ideals. It makes for riveting viewing as Jericho's tiny geopolitical dynamics are shaken up and a new, more aggressive social culture emerges. It's a whole new world, a crappy, blighted one. The standard of living has devolved. Horses become a popular, fuel-saving alternative to automobiles. Windmills prove to be a seriously viable source of energy. Food is rationed, ammo is doled out, medicine is hoarded. Money loses value. Bartering is the new money. For Jericho, its salt mines provide an invaluable trading commodity. Meanwhile, the residents are still in the dark as to how widespread the destruction is, or if America still even exists as they know it.Despite the post-apocalyptic, sci-fi setting, JERICHO is fueled by human drama. The show doesn't make the mistake of forsaking storytelling for flash. Oh, there are taut action sequences here and there (\"Rogue River,\" \"Crossroads,\" & the final 4 episodes). And the ongoing suspense is there, even though the series commits itself to a slow burn, taking its sweet time in divulging answers (which probably threw off some viewers). But, mostly, the focus is on the characters' development and their personal story arcs, set in a world-gone-mad backdrop. Jericho is a tiny town, with its share of secrets and notoriety. Extramarital stuff goes on, and family conflict. Political wrangling goes on. A local crime lord lurks on the fringes. A secretive neighbor moves in. But Jericho is also a place where redemption can be earned, estranged families reunited, a sense of community galvanized, and a sweet but unlikely romance blossom between, say, a down-to-earth farmer and a prickly IRS auditor.The acting is very good, the performances, for the greater part, grow on one and impact in the emotional gut. It's a pretty hefty ensemble cast, but JERICHO gravitates towards the Greens, Jericho's first family and led by patriarch and town mayor Johnston Green (a wonderfully understated Gerald McRaney), who also happens to be an ex-Army Ranger. It's so nice to check in with McRaney again, as I haven't seen him since hisSimon & Simon - Season Onedays (I dug it whenever Johnston put on his cowboy hat). I like that he and Pamela Reed achieve a certain believability as a longtime married couple. Props also to the hissable Michael Gaston, who plays Johnston's scheming political rival Gray Anderson, a fella you can't help but throw middle fingers at. I'm not sure how much acting chops it takes to make your character so detested, but Gaston pulls it off. It helps that Anderson isn't nasty all the time, and, in fact, fervently believes that he's a guy doing the right thing, and, sometimes, he even does. Meanwhile, while Ashley Scott is a striking actress, I wish more screen time had also been given to the quietly vibrant Sprague Grayden, who plays schoolteacher/car mechanic/engineer/all-around cutie Heather Lisinski. I like her as much as Scott, with both gorgeous actresses flaunting a nice chemistry with lead actor Skeet Ulrich. On a minus, I wasn't digging Dale, that taciturn kid who works at the grocery store. The earlier shows made him a sympathetic character, but, later on, he transforms into an unlikable opportunist.But the two most interesting - and enigmatic - characters happen to be Jake Green and Robert Hawkins. Jake, effectively played by Skeet Ulrich, is JERICHO's stoic central hero and is the Green family's troubled black sheep who returns to town after five mysterious years of absence. No one's privy to what Jake's been thru since he went away, but, there's no doubt at all that his many newfound skills go quite a ways in keeping Jericho afloat in the trying times ahead. It doesn't take long before the townspeople start looking to Jake as their go-to guy. Another intriguing character is the immensely capable, new-to-town Robert Hawkins (British actor Lennis James, here sporting a Yankee accent), who passes himself off as a St. Louis cop (he's not). Lennis James does a great job of ambiguously toeing that line between good guy and bad guy, all the while exuding that dangerous vibe; you're just never quite sure which side he's on (I mean, even his family is wary of him). Regarding Jake and Hawkins, we don't really get the backstory until the episodes \"The Day Before\" and \"A.K.A.\"There aren't a lot of weak episodes here, with each one integral to the ongoing story arc and several being of the heartwrenching sort (\"Winter's End,\" \"Why We Fight\"). Episode 17 (\"One Man's Terrorist\") I wasn't too fond of, that one focusing on Emily's amazingly bland fiance Roger. But then the ensuing five episodes frenetically bring it home. In the months ahead, it'll turn out that Jericho, even with its assorted problems, had fared better than most other places. This makes the town a desirable target. This plays out in the last four episodes, culminating in the slam bang finale as Jericho is forced to go to war against an invading neighboring town. Season One's final episode \"Why We Fight\" ends on a cliffhanger, at which point, CBS pulled the plug on the series. And, boy, did that tick people off. But, thanks to the concerted efforts of its fans, who delivered thousands of pounds of nuts to CBS, the network greenlit a second season in the form of seven new episodes. And thank goodness! Seriously, a cliffhanger is NOT the way to go out!Sidenote: Here's a cool gimmick: Each episode features a different Morse code played over the title shot, which offers a hint of what's going on in that particular episode. I've got to learn Morse code.JERICHO - THE FIRST SEASON comes in a 6 disc package, and CBS doesn't stint on the bonus features. \"Building Jericho\" is the interesting 24-minute-long Making Of documentary, which includes snippets of cast audition clips (of Lennis James, Kenneth Mitchell, Pamela Reed, and Sprague Grayden). \"What If?\" is a sobering 9-minute segment delving into the history of the atomic bomb and the terrifying possibility of a nuclear attack today. You want episode commentaries? Or deleted scenes? You got 'em! Fifteen of the 22 episodes come with either an episode commentary or deleted scenes (or, sometimes, both). The commentaries are mostly by the executive producers (exec. producer/director Jon Turteltaub is actually kinda funny), although Skeet and Lennie James do pop in to drop their own words (Skeet in \"Rogue River\"; Lennie in \"Red Flag\"; Skeet & Lennie in \"Vox Populi\"). Would've been nice, though, to have commentary on the last episode \"Why We Fight.\" But, overall, not too shabby for extras.Now, if only the eyeball network can see fit to extend the second season beyond a mere seven episodes...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"There are some things the Apocalypse can't change.\"", "unixReviewTime": 1203724800, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2008"}, {"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B000UU4IX0", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [21, 27], "reviewText": "Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having \"us\" attack \"them\" by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the \"stand alone\" variety. All of the \"mythology\" episodes (to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3. The death of Jammer: In \"Collaborators\" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying \"Adama wouldn't lie to me\" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: \"I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie.\" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, \"And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral.\" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5. \"Exodus, Pt. 2\": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained \"The Adama Maneuver\" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named \"Exodus, Pt. 2\" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6. The fight between Kara and Lee in \"Unfinished Business.\" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, \"I missed you.\" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, \"I missed you too.\" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six \"I love you\" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's--giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: \"The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues \"a bogie at my ten\" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, assures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, \"It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there.\" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci-fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clich&eacute;s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans.

I preferred to watch Star Trek. However, I am hooked on this remake. The acting is great and the plot captivating. The characters are believable, and the cinematography quite spectacular. There are many twists in the story: you will be eagerly awaiting the next episode. My favorite character: Kate `Starbuck'!Though I did not like Battlestar Galactica Razor, and actually started Season 3 with low expectations because of it, I ended up loving Season 3.Season 2 ended with the Cylons discovering and invading New Caprica. Gaius Baltar, the President of the twelve colonies, surrenders to them, while Galactica and the rest of the fleet escape.Season 3 opens with the stranded Colonials struggling to survive under the Cylon rule. A terrorist group is formed to fight the Cylons, and sacrifices are made. We see humans strapping themselves with bombs, and blowing themselves up in the presence of Cylons and their human sympathizers.Can we stop for a second here? Isn't this what the Palestinians are doing in Israel, and the Iraqis in Iraq? What are the producers of this show trying to tell us? Is it that whenever a nation takes over another all means at one's disposal should be used to attack the invader, including using humans as bombs? Furthermore, terrorism is shown to be in the eye of the beholder. To the colonials, the terrorists are freedom fighters. To the Cylons, they are simply terrorists. There are some provocative scenes, but after all, this is the kind of world we live in.We are shown Admiral Adama struggling with his crew to save the colonials, and to resume his quest to find Earth. The following is a spoiler so stop reading now if you haven't watched the show yet: Adama does come back to New Caprica and rescues the Colonials. The Season continues with trying to find Earth. New clues are discovered, and a planet is found where early Earth settlers lived.Season 3 focuses on the human element, survival, and punishment. Even after the Colonials are rescued by Adama, some crew members take the role of vigilante, ejecting betrayers into space out of an airlock. These `victims' are not judged by a jury of their peers, nor are they given legal representation.  Again we are shown how people broken by war resort to unconventional and immoral actions that are fully justifiable by them alone. Again, depends through which eyes you are looking. Adama did not see such actions justifiable, and he put a stop to them. However, the perpetrators, or self-appointed jury, were never charged.I very much liked the episode where a chance is given to Adama to exterminate the Cylons. There is talk of genocide, and many in the fleet are against exterminating the Cylons. But wait a second. Cylons are machines. If today we decided to destroy all Windows based PCs in the world in favor for Apple, would this be genocide? What if some of the Windows PC contained human DNA, would destroying them then qualify as genocide? Meanwhile, though, the Cylons decide against exterminating the human race, resorting to living in harmony with them. Again, the writers manage to include provocative topics in this series. Isn't this what good TV is all about?Another episode I liked was the trial of Gaius Baltar, bringing to mind scenes from John Grisham. Again, whether Baltar is a traitor or not depends on the eye of the beholder. We know he was forced to take certain actions by the Cylons, but we also know that he had his own motivations in certain actions as well. His trial brings up many provocative and controversial topics. I personally thought that episode was the best one. I like it when TV episodes make me think days on end.The Season ends with a huge revelation: some of the Galactica crew are actually Cylons. I won't tell you who, because I know some of you who haven't seen the show will read this review, and this revelation could spoil the whole season! Just let's say you will be utterly surprised. However, I think the writers took a big risk with such a revelation. We'll have to wait for Season 4 to see what all of this means. Will the Cylons and human beings end up living in harmony?Starbuck is also resurrected in the last episode. We saw her die three episodes earlier. She says to Lee,\"It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is, and I'm going to take us there.\" Is she a Cylon too? Did Lee see another Starbuck copy?I really enjoyed the bonus disk, \"The Story so far.\" This episode recaps all that happened from the beginning of Season 1 to this Season. There were many scenes I had forgotten, and this episode sort of brought everything together again.There is only one issue I have with this show: I think there are too many standalone episodes that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show. The major appeal of this show (at least to me) is its continuity: how each episode continues on the previous one. Seeing too many standalone episodes kind of destroys the flow of the storyline, and slows down the action.Battlestar Galactica is a great show for all sci-fi fans! Like Razor, Season 3 is shot in HD (High Definition).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Provocative sci-fi at its best!", "unixReviewTime": 1203638400, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2008"}, {"reviewerID": "A1KE3JBO3KQX2O", "asin": "B000WFFAIA", "reviewerName": "Brian C.", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I recently watched seasons 3 through 6 of Bones on Netflix and I decided I would review each season, but I want to preface each of my reviews with three comments. First, I want to give my SPOILER ALERT. I do not shy away from giving away what happens in each season so DO NOT read my reviews if you have not already watched ALL of the seasons (I sometimes give away things in later seasons in reviews for earlier seasons as well, so be careful if you have not watched all the way through season 6).Second, despite the tone of my reviews I really enjoy the show. I do not watch much television, but I have watched all of Bones, and I would not have watched all of it if I did not find it enjoyable. That having been said, my reviews are going to mostly be complaints. I am (I am afraid) one of those human beings who decides to take to the internet to air their grievances on a public forum, because they think their opinions are really more important than they really are. So these reviews are mostly grievances despite the fact that I really like the show. I just find it is easier to talk about what I do not like, rather than what I do like.Third, these reviews are not really written for people who are new to the show, or have not watched the seasons. In fact, these reviews are probably not written for anyone other than myself. But if anyone else should get any enjoyment from them, I would not be upset. I am actually curious to know whether other people share some of my complaints, so if you do (or you don't) and you feel like posting a comment under my review please feel free to do so. Okay, now to the review.I will actually begin with something that I really enjoyed from Season 3, and that is the Gormogon story arc. Bones is essentially a formula show. Each episode there is a murder. They all start out the same way, with some unsuspecting person happening across a dead body. The show then sets up three or four suspects, before finally settling on one. But the show does not usually have an overarching, season long, mystery to solve. I enjoy it when a show sets up a season long mystery (like in Dexter) that only gets solved at the end of the season, and I actually wish Bones did more of that. Gormogon is really only the focus of a few episodes from the season (if I am remembering correctly) and there are always individual murders to solve each episode, but it is nice to have the Gormogon mystery hovering in the background throughout most of the season.I was not, however, entirely satisfied with how the Gormogon mystery was resolved (this is where my SPOILER ALERT is in effect). The notion that Zack Addy was an accomplice to the Gormogon I actually thought was a good idea. I like it when shows surprise, and I like it when a show lets the audience know that the main characters are not off limits, and that anything can happen. One way of doing that is by having a character who everyone has become familiar with, and perhaps even grown to love, turn out to be the accomplice of a murdering cannibal.The problem I have is that shows rarely have the courage to trust their audience. If you are going to have a main character turn out to be the accomplice of a cannibal, it would be better to go as dark as possible with it. But shows always tend to pull back at the last minute. First, they pull back by having Zack blow up his own hands in order to protect one of his workmates. I am not saying they should have had Zack kill one of the other main characters, but they clearly set that up in order to downplay Zack's \"evilness\" (for lack of a better term). I think if you are going to go for it, you need to go all the way, otherwise you do not really make anyone happy. You upset the people who do not like to see the main characters messed with at all, and you upset the people who enjoy that kind of thing by not having the courage to go all the way with it. You cannot do something like that half-way. It would have, in my opinion, been great to find out that a character you had been watching for three seasons was genuinely evil, rather than simply misguided by logic. It could have potentially raised some continuity issues, but I think those could have been dealt with by simply saying that he was hiding his true identity.And that brings me to my second complaint with the resolution. One of the recurring themes of the show is the debate between logic (or science) and emotion (or faith). Or the debate between the head and heart if you prefer. The show never really succeeds, in my opinion, in dealing with this theme in a very deep way, which, admittedly, I think is too much to expect from a television show. Part of the problem, in my opinion, is that they caricature each position. There is very little subtlety. The representatives of the \"logic\" camp (Brennan and Zach) are all logic, and the representatives of the emotion camp (Booth and Angela) are all emotion. The solution to why Zack fell in with the Gormogon is that he let himself be deceived by logic, and this is supposed to represent the dangers of pure logic. That is an interesting idea (although, personally, I think the world tends to suffer from too little logic, and not too much) but to be executed correctly it needs to be more subtle, and more logical. There is nothing very logical about Zack's decision to fall in with the Gormogon. Brennan, when she finds out, attempts to reconstruct the syllogism behind Zack's decision, but it is not a very strong logical argument at all, and certainly not an argument that would convince anyone with even average intelligence, let alone someone of Zack's supposed intelligence. The notion that Zack would choose to murder people based on such a poor logical argument is highly implausible, and was clearly an attempt to partially absolve Zack from the crimes by removing any actual evil intent.In this season it is also discovered that Zack is responsible for stabbing the last victim of the Gormogon to death. But in the next season (another SPOILER) the show again pulls back by revealing that Zack did not really stab anyone, and he only confessed to the murder because he revealed where the victim lived to the Gormogon (who apparently was incapable of discovering that for himself?) and felt responsible for the man's death. In other words, the show takes the step of making the killer one of the main characters, but then does everything it possibly can to pull back from that decision. In my opinion, you should either go for it or not. Either you make the main character a killer, in which case, you go the whole nine yards, and make him evil as well, or you find another killer. This, to me, is a recurring pattern that you see in television shows. Apparently writers and producers do not trust that the audience will go along with them, or they think people will be too upset, or too shocked. And maybe they are right. I imagine they have done more research on the subject than I have. But still, speaking from my own personal perspective, I would like to see a show go all the way with it sometime, and not pull back at the last minute.Now, I have one more complaint with the third season, but before I launch into that, I think I should say something positive about this season. I was not sure when Dr. Lance Sweets (played by John Francis Daley) was introduced into the show, but it says on Wikipedia that it was in the third season, and I think he was an excellent addition to the cast. I think part of the reason I like him is because I was a big fan of Freaks and Geeks (although it took me at least a season before I realized it was the same actor since he is not a kid anymore), but I also enjoy the character, and his interactions with Booth and Brennan. So if Wikipedia is right, and this was the season that Sweets was introduced, then that is a definite plus for this season in my book.The last thing I want to mention, or complain about rather, is the episode where Booth is shot, and the succeeding episode. There is not really any big spoiler here, since obviously the show goes on, and Booth remains a central character, I knew that Booth could not really have died, but the episode where he is shot ends without knowing for sure if he lived. The next episode, to my surprise, begins with his funeral. I will save the reader the details of how the show finds its way out of this mess (of course Booth is not really dead) but let's just say it was a pretty ridiculous solution that made no sense. If they wanted to leave the viewer in suspense for the first five minutes of the episode after Booth was shot they could have found a better way. I realize that shows have to stretch realism to a certain degree, and I am willing to suspend my disbelief up to a point, but there are limits. The solution, in this case, is totally implausible and makes no sense.So that is my opinion. And now I am sending it out into the world, and pretending like there are other people out there who are actually interested...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One person's opinion...", "unixReviewTime": 1337558400, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE", "asin": "B000WHIIO6", "reviewerName": "cinephiliagal", "helpful": [20, 27], "reviewText": "First off, I've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they've all had some things in common, and they've all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin-off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of assorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short-lived (3 seasons) CBS \"Crime Time After Prime Time\" early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the \"monster\" he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks/backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being \"turned\" vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other's lives (plot device), and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight's big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his \"gift\" of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who'd lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn't. He never wanted to be a vampire -- he didn't even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has \"trust issues.\" She, from her perspective, gave him a \"gift\" of eternal life -- freedom from death (sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little \"family\" (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he \"does good\" as a PI because he feels guilty about the \"bad\" he's done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don't kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother's little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick's distant \"relationship\" with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox's character Lucy edits on FX's show Dirt, except it's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, \"No Such Thing as Vampires,\" Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news-whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn't watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS' web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin's eye-candy good looks, I've always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin. She also isn't your typical stick-thin, anorexic-looking TV actress; the girl's got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a \"real\" woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B-movie (or is that B-TV) hell. I thought, \"Eh, that was was pretty; I'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better.\" I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn't expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I'd watch as \"webisodes\" and not much else.Surprisingly, it's getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline. It's still eye candy, but I don't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we're up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self-hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick \"went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster\" has only improved the show's \"grab\" factor. The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network-TV-permissible) scenes on later eps and I'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making. They're still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not \"serious\" literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it's not the genre that defines the shows, it's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, \"No Such Thing As Vampires,\" and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "predictable, cliche-ish eye-candy that gets better in later eps", "unixReviewTime": 1195776000, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2007"}, {"reviewerID": "A3UDYY6L2NH3JS", "asin": "B000WT7R6O", "reviewerName": "Jacques COULARDEAU \"A soul doctor, so to say\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This is the season when Dean dies because he has dealt Sam's survival in the place of his own life by trading his soul with a demon, and he got a one year delay before going to hell. The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean. Sam will resist the idea of Dean's death and will do all he can to save him, including by dealing his own death instead, but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster, the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother, and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season, and this war has brought them nothing as for life, enjoying life, etc. Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all, or even a dry bone. For Sam the only problem is that Dean's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.We could think then the season would be rather dull. But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.First it is fun to fight demons. So we have a Christmas special this year, and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting. And neither of them both forgot to get a present, no matter how little, for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake, a scam, a tall tale. But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration. We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House. One of the dummies will die in the adventure, the intern of course which does not count much, not one of the brains of the caper, and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs, reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.Third let's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters. So let's have one full episode on fairy tales. Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father, the doctor, who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma. The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale. So let's go back to work, boys.This year is built on the presence of two women. Bela, who could be Bella of course, is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit. She steals anything the boys, particularly Dean, may have in their pockets. A mummified hand for example, an enchanted rabbit's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet. But that is too much, far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up, like in Hellraiser and Hellbound, two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker, stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever, each body part growing back after having been ripped off, I guess. A delicious ending for a monster hunter.A second woman, Ruby, who is a demon possessing a woman, is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept. But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith, the demon who is after Dean's life. So he can't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage, who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around, so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living. And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell. Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they can't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby. The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away. She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell, Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her. End of the season. Let's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season. They get rid of Gordon, the black hunter and some of his acolytes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their nave feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant. He let the two boys go, but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith, possessing a little blonde girl (evil can be everywhere and come in all forms) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it, including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent. Isn't that sad? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders. But the redemption of Victor Henricksen, Special Agent by profession, is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed. His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field. The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify. Come with me, Come with me, come with me, and you will know. Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end. But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson's Thriller, If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all. And that's where plagiarism is not what it used to be. Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there, like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale. We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old. Mad scientist, mad doctor, or whatever. There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street. Aren't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard? I would be if I were you. You might be snatched by two moths from out space. Plagiarism you said? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive, but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out, especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now. But the car is also less present in this season. Sam has his own, by the way, and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes. It is present for sure, but certainly less than before. I hope it is not for long because I like the machine. The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised. They own the car together and it brings them together. The car being their only real possession, something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family, keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together. On the trail leading to Dean's death, the car cannot keep them together or close, because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him, sometimes in ill-advised directions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A little bit of wind at the Crossroads of thise series", "unixReviewTime": 1322697600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2011"}, {"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B000ZU1KMW", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [39, 61], "reviewText": "Warning!  Many, many, many spoilers below.  Do NOT read if you want to stay spoiler free.In watching Season 4.0 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (when Universal released the first ten episodes of Season Two of BSG at the end of a near six month hiatus they dubbed the first half of the season 2.0 and the second half 2.5; that has been continued with 4.0 and 4.5), I kept thinking of soemthing one of the world's best known self-proclaimed BSG fiends, Joss Whedon, once said.  Sometimes you have to give fans what they need rather than what they want.  Not everything that happened in Season 4.0 was what any of us wanted, but in the end, I think we'll find that we got what we needed.  (BTW, Ron Moore asked Joss to direct an episode of BSG and was more than willing to do so, but preparation for his new series DOLLHOUSE, which will pair BUFFY and ANGEL alumna Eliza Dushku with BSG alumnus Tahmoh Penikett, placed demands on him that prevented him from being able to do so.  Part of me deeply regrets this, because my two favorite shows of all time are BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  As Jack White says, \"Oh well, oh well, oh well.\")No show in the history of TV has had more truly great and shocking endings than BSG.  BUFFY had two season finales that were as good as any I've seen (Seasons Two and Five -- the climatic scene from the Season Five finale, \"The Gift,\" was recently voted in landslide fashion on the official Emmy 2008 website as the Most Memorable Moment in TV history), but because Joss Whedon was always and wisely terrified of the cancellation of his shows, he would not end any season on a cliffhanger.  Ron Moore and David Eick have bravely ended each season with some of the greatest cliffhangers in TV history.  My favorite may have been the end of Season Three:  the Cylon fleet bearing down on the Colonials, who will not be able to engage their FTL (faster-than-light) engines for several minutes, the sitar-drive version of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" playing in the background.  Apollo goes to investigate a mysterious bogey only to discover the deceased Starbuck flying a Viper as shiney and clean as the day it came off the assembly line.  She comforts him with the words, \"It's going to be alright.  I've been to earth.  And I'm going to take us there.\"  Then the breathtaking CGI shot of a \"camera\" pulling back over the two Vipers, through the Colonial fleet, through the Cylon fleet, through the nebula, then across the universe until it comes to rest on a beautiful blue planet showing the continent of North America basking in the sun.  It was a jaw dropping moment and the question was whether Season Four could pick up successfully at that moment.Well, of course it could.  And did.  After learning the identity of four members of the Final Five we knew that the final season would primarily deal with two major questions:  1) Who is the final Cylon? and 2) Will they reach earth and what will they find there if they do?  I think everyone would have put money on the first question being answered first and the second one in the final episode of the series.  But shockingly the second question was answered first, and in the finale seconds of the final episode before the hiatus.Much of 4.0 focused on Starbuck striving to convince Adama and everyone else that whe was not a Cylon and that she really did know the way to earth.  Though many harbor deep suspicions, in the end Starbuck is able to persuade the fleet to go where she believes earth can be found.  In an absolutely brilliant moment, she succeeds.  I had managed to avoid spoilers (in fact, though I was a pretty well known poster on the official BSG board on Scifi.com, I stopped visiting there in order to avoid spoilers) so I had absolutely no idea that they were going to reach earth so much earlier than anyone had assumed.  Indeed, even in interviews leading up to the episode, Ron Moore indicated that they would get to earth before the end of the series, not giving any clues that in fact it would be in the very next episode.  So a viewer's first shock is that they found earth at all.  Even as the Raptors and other atmospheric spacecraft descend to the earth's surface, another shock takes over.  In one of the great one shots I've ever seen on TV, a camera focuses in close on the bandaged hand of Adama, scooping up liveless soil, a Geiger counter registering high levels of radioactivity.  The camera raises up slowly to register the blank expressions of Adama and, standing beside him, Roslin, who utters the shot's lone word, \"Earth.\"  The model 3 Cylon known as D'Anna walks up beside them, horror on her face, as Sharon and Helo walk behind them.  The camera then loosely follows the two of them as they walk all the way to the far right, stopping along the way to register the reactions of the other major surviving characters on the show.  First Cylons Anders and Tory, the same expression of despair on their faces.  Then cutting in front of them Apollo, who walks further to reveal Caprica Six in the background, Baltar sitting in the foreground, and Tyrol behind her.  Six walks past Dee in the foreground over to Colonel Tigh, lightly touching his arm.  Past Apollo, who has stopped walking, past Leoben, briefly back to Sharon and Helo who continue walking, to Starbuck, who turns and walks over to where they have stopped.  The camera continues on its own to reveal a body of water and a destroyed bridge, ruins everywhere.  It is a scene that will remind any viewer strongly of the end of PLANET OF THE APES.  I have to add that there is no hint that this was New York or any other city.  Though one ruin clearly features a large carved cross, apparently denoting a Christian building of some sort, there are no other signs of what they have found.  Many assume that the bridge is the Brooklyn Bridge, but anyone even minimally familiar with that bridge's design knows that it is not.  Some argue that it isn't really earth, but I just don't think that argument holds water.4.0 was not very happy.  These were sad, upsetting, bleak, despairing episodes.  But I truly believe that they were what we needed and not what we wanted.  Most of us would have had more fighting, more combat, more huge space battles.  But we wouldn't have broken new ground or challenged its viewers.  The mark of a great show is that it takes you to places that you couldn't expect existed.  Most of us have impoverished imaginations and as a result think in small, hackneyed ways.  I wasn't always happy with Season Four.  My favorite character is Sharon Agathon and on various boards I speculated that her story had largely ended in Season Three, after the last major question (What would she do when she found out that Hera was alive and that Roslin had stolen her from Sharon?) was answered (Answer:  She would do whatever she needed to get back Hera, but nothing to harm Roslin.).  Season Four showed her as an anti-Cylon zealot, even assassinating a Six who was striving to create some sort of working arrangement with the humans.  We got fewer humorous encounters between Six and Baltar.  We didn't get to visit interesting planets.  Happy times were not had.  But as I've reflected back over the show as a whole, I have been amazed at the astonishing journey that it has taken us on.  In fact, the show in 4.0 even departed from so much of the political allegory that dominated the first two and a half seasons.We are now set up for the final ten episodes of a show that has completely redescribed what it is possible to do within the confines of a science fiction show.  In part it did this by refusing to succumb to a single one of the tried and true conventions of the genre.  And it did this by never repeating itself.  Along with another show that was launched in 2004, LOST, it has helped create a new kind of television narrative:  the very long story.  Other shows had attempted this to some degree.  Each season of BUFFY told a self-contained story, with some elements that carried over from one season to the next.  THE X-FILES spent several seasons on the alien colonization story (though more than half of each season's episodes were standalone episodes).  BABYLON 5 had elements that took the first four seasons to resolve (though there were a number of reasons the narrative wasn't as successful as it should have been).  But LOST and BSG will be the first two that will have told a single story through the course of the show with a beginning, middle, and an end.  Other shows are following in this path.  I think it makes for tremendous television, even if it doesn't always pull in a lot of viewers.Finally, I'd like to engage in a little speculation.  I've made a couple of predictions before.  Both of them turned out correct, even if one of them was only partially correct.  I think I was the first person on the Internet to predict how Sharon would get Hera; because I knew they had only 42 minutes for Sharon to somehow get to the Cylon basestar and back with Hera, I predicted that someone would kill her (with the Cylon prohibition of suicide, I knew she would kill herself) and that she would grab Hera and return to the Colonial fleet, possibly on a heavy raider.  Well, I didn't know they had a Raptor on board, but I got close.  (I know I was the first to post this theory on the official board and it only appeared elsewhere after that).  The second prediction was that Tyrol was one of the Final Five.  What I got wrong was that three others would also be revealed.  My third prediction has been a short list of the final Cylon.  I don't have room to give all of my reasons for my theory, but it hinges on a passage in a book that Roslin reads aloud to Adama on the Temple of the Five in \"The Eye of Jupiter.\"  She reads, \"The five pillars represent the five priests who are devoted to the one whose name cannot be na--\" and she is cut off by Adama, who says, \"Laura.\"  I argue that this is a literary convention in which the one whose name cannot be named is indirectly revealed.  Basically, I believe the key to the Final Five is that they are crucial to helping Roslin lead the survivors to earth.  Tigh, Tyrol, Tory, and Anders all beautiful fit this.  My other argument is that the final cylon could not have been in a position to respond to the song that the other four heard at the end of Season Four.  Using these two, I came up with the short list of Billy, Kat, and Elosha.  Of the three, Billy was closest to Roslin and he remains my first choice.  Elosha was not, I thought, a sufficiently important character to satisfy the requirements of the final cylon.  Kat slightly fits the bill, and Starbuck's talking to her photo just before they get to earth strengthens her case.  I still think the final Cylon is most likely Billy.  But unless Ron Moore has flat out been lying, neither Adama (especially not Zak) nor Starbuck is the final Cylon.  We'll see if my third and final prediction is correct or not.But there is no question that BSG has helped redefine what it is possible to do on a television series.  It has taken narrative to new levels, has introduced a moral and spiritual darkness that surpasses even THE SOPRANOS, and has shown that you can completely redefine an other moribund genre, making Science Fiction that speaks more to adults than the teenagers.  I can't wait for the final ten episodes.Edit -- 1/18/09 -- Well, I was wrong on the final Cylon (if, that is, Tigh is correct).  I was half right in my reasoning.  I was convinced that it couldn't be someone who was with the fleet and that they were most likely dead.  But I was equally confident that they were supporters of Laura Roslin.  To that degree the person currently revealed as the final Cylon doesn't make a lot of sense.  But one of the things about being the executive producers is that things in the end don't have to make a lot of sense.  That said, the Season 4.5 opener was a stunning episode in many, many ways, and further proof of just how great this show is.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "More brilliant episodes of one of television's landmark series", "unixReviewTime": 1224115200, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2008"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B0012QRPU4", "reviewerName": "Dennis A.

His wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) is pregnant and his son Walter White Jr. (RJ Mitte) is physically challenged.  The family are struggling financially and behind on bills.Walter tries to provide for his family by working two jobs.  He is a very intelligent chemist that can probably work anywhere and make a lot of money but yet he teaches chemistry to high school students (who have no care in chemistry) and then having to work part time at a car wash in which his students mock him for it.  To make matters worse, Walter has just discovered that he has inoperable lung cancer.Knowing that his family has no money, he doesn't tell his family about it.  In fact, he keeps the cancer to himself and with all the crap going in his life, this is the last thing he needs.Depressed and just out of it, he is surprised that his wife has a surprise 50th birthday party with all his friends and his family (with their friends).  He watches his sister-in-law Marie's boyfriend Hank (Dean Norris) is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agent on television and how he goes after the notorious drug dealers in New Mexico and has been successful. Always finding a way to poke fun at Walter's weakness, he offers Walter a chance to go on a DEA ride-along as they go after drug dealers.  But what catches Walter's eye is the discussion of how much money is made by these drug dealers.So, Walter decides one day to take on Hank's offer to  go on a ride along for a crystal meth bust.  He sees how chemistry is applied to crystal meth, how it's developed in their labs and how these drug dealers are making really crappy products.  With basic chemistry, he can cook the finest crystal meth and possibly make some money for him and his family.So, during the bust, he sees a former student named Jesse Pinkman escaping from the area of the drug bust.  Walter goes to Jesse's residence after the busts and tells him that he wants to join forces with him.  He'll create the best crystal meth using his intelligent chemist skills and Jesse finds a way to make money.In an unlikely collaboration, both Walter and Jesse begin to work with each other.  But because Walter's crystal meth is perfect, Jesse's distributor want to know who's cooking it.  Thus they go to where Walter is cooking and threaten the both of them. In trouble, Walter uses his chemistry skills to create a cloud of poison and thus killing the drug dealers.Caught up in a botched up drug deal, both Walter and Jesse have now crossed the line and now have murdered one and keeping the other captive in the basement of Jesse's home.Walter goes from a ho-hum life to a criminal life involving drugs, theft and murder.  And because he needs money badly, he gets him and Jesse farther into criminal territory with ruthless drug dealers.  Meanwhile, his sister-in-law's DEA boyfriend is on the hunt for the person creating the perfect crystal meth.The first season of \"BREAKING BAD\" features a total of seven episodes.

An intelligent discussion among professionals.* Screen Tests - The actual screen tests for Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris.* Breaking Bad on AMC - The AMC commercial for \"Breaking Bad\"JUDGMENT CALL:What an excellent series \"BREAKING BAD\" turned out to be.  I was really impressed by the Vince Gilligan's writing and the talent of Bryan Cranston (who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for \"BREAKING BAD\") in such a demanding role.I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching the series because I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch a television series that may glorify crystal meth and it's good to know that the series doesn't.In fact, it's more about a television series about a very intelligent man making a very stupid decision that will eventually take him to the lowest of lows in order to make money for his family and his treatment.It's so shocking that Walter H. White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.And that is what is so impressive with \"BREAKING BAD\" is that it's a series that is well-written, smart but dark, shocking and even disturbing at times.  And what helps break from the typical dark and depressing storylines is the other characters and the chemistry these characters have with the main character of Walter White.Anna Gunn as Skyler White, a loving wife, mother and sister other does an excellent job of playing a character with so many layers.  In one scene, she may be the concerned housewife and then another scene, the sultry wife who wants to make love to her husband.Then you have Walter's chemistry with the drug dealer Jesse.  Two unlikely people who would never be together in society but now having to work with each other in making money and despite the viewer feeling empathy for Walter because of his health condition and trying to make ends meet for his family, you can foresee nothing but darkness as both Walter and Jesse continue the downward spiral of working in the criminal underground.You see Walter eventually understanding that he put himself in a terrible position.  Having to work with unstable drug dealers, watching Jesse getting beaten and bloodied and even these two having to get involved in various criminal activities.This is not a television series glorifying drugs, it's a series that shows the seedy, dark and gritty criminal underground and things are not all rosy.  I was shocked about the developments that happen in the series which I rather not spoil for the viewer but you have to watch and see for yourself.  Definitely many twists and turns in this television series.Overall, \"BREAKING BAD\" is a unique, well-written and well-acted television series.  Surprisingly, AMC of all cable networks to showcase two exceptional dramatic series (the other is \"MADMEN\") is impressive and you can only think of how far this series will go.  The first season for \"BREAKING BAD\" really was surprising, entertaining and unique.  I was very impressed and looking back, I'm still quite shocked about a few certain scenes.An excellent television series thus far and I look forward in the upcoming twists and turns for the second season.  \"BREAKING BAD - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON\" is definitely recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dark, gripping and unique!

A mild mannered high school chemistry teacher, he just turns 50 as the show starts. His wife is expecting another child, his first some is a well adjusted 16 year old with cp and life for Walter is just, well boring.Walter's job doesn't hold the glamour for him that it did when he began. After years of teaching (or at least trying to teach) kids chemistry and trying to pass along his passion for this knowledge, he now faces a generation that more so than the rest just doesn't care or take an interest. His second job working at a car wash results in an extra income but more degradation as the owner routinely disrespects him and has him do menial jobs.The worst finally comes around when Walter collapses at the car wash and is rushed to the hospital. Not informing his family, Walter is told by the doctors there that he has terminal, inoperable lung cancer. Where does one go when their entire world collapses around them?For Walter it comes in the form of his brother-in-law, a tough talking jovial DEA agent named Hank (Dean Norris). Cajoled by Hank time and again, he takes him up on his offer to go on a ride along when then next meth lab bust takes place. There is method to Walter's madness here. He wants to get a glimpse of the set up being used with plans of making meth on his own to sell and make a fortune that he can then leave his family. Fate steps in as Walter sees a young man escape from the house next door and recognizes him as Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), an ex-student of his.Walter tracks down Jesse and offers him a proposition. He wants to be the chemist involved in making the meth that Jesse would then in turn distribute. A straight business deal that would yield them both a nice wad of cash. To do so they need a place to cook and with the DEA seeking out houses being used, Walter comes up with a plan. A Winnebago, a meth lab on wheels.They get set up, make their first batch and Jesse is stunned by the purity of the product. Walter gets in a poke at Jesse concerning his ability to listen and learn, something he didn't seem to do in high school. Had he done so in chemistry class, he would have learned the tools he needed to become a major drug provider.So here we have the set up. This is a true anti-hero if there ever was one. A mild mannered suburbanite turned into a major drug dealer? Yes this is the basis for the series. But don't misunderstand. It doesn't glorify the drug culture or Walter's decision to create drugs. The story more involves Walter's attempt to do a good deed in providing for his family but at the same time making decisions that place himself and them in jeopardy. It's more about living with your wrong decisions and watching as Walter and Jesse attempt to save themselves from the decisions they made.As the series progresses (only 7 episodes) we watch as Walter comes to life. Perhaps it's the sense of danger, perhaps the fact that he is living outside of his comfort zone or perhaps it's that he is facing death by cancer that has made Walter change. We see him move from mild mannered chemistry teacher to a man willing to walk into the home base of a wild and jacked up drug dealer to demand respect and money.But the series isn't just about that. It's also about his wife and her love of her husband as she tries to understand his change, not knowing until halfway through the series that he has cancer. It's about his son dealing not only with his own problems but with a father he loves but hasn't quite learned to respect. It's about a man driven so far to the edge that he gets involved with drug manufacturing even though his brother-in-law is a DEA agent. It's about a man who when faced with what he feels are no options, turns to the darkest part of his soul. It's about life as we probably all wish we never have to experience.The series is not just a hard edged drama though. Throughout the escapades of Walter and Jesse we get plenty of actual laughs. Whether it's Walter standing in the middle of a road in his tighty whiteys with a gun he doesn't know how to use or Walter grabbing his wife's thigh in the midst of a PTA meeting, there are some truly funny moments.When I first heard of this show it didn't interest me, it didn't sound like something I'd like. The more I watched it on DVD though, the more invested in these characters I became. I liked Walter but not what he did. I felt for Jesse but wished he seek treatment. And I hoped that this family would find a way to survive everything that happened to them.It might not be the cup of tea that the average renter would enjoy. But the dark humor, the danger and the interest in the main character make this compelling viewing as it progresses. Cranston and Paul do a fantastic job as an odd couple for the current state of affairs. And once the series ends, you find yourself looking forward to season two (coming out on DVD soon as well as season 3 starting on AMC in March 2010).One thing that has to be mentioned again about this series. It's the story of a man who produces crystal meth. It would be easy to write the series off as an homage to meth dealers and manufacturers. But that isn't at its root what the story is about. It's about a man who makes the wrong decisions for the right reasons and then has to face the consequences. Movie makers have made films about bad guys doing bad things for years and yet we've found ourselves both enjoying the films and rooting at times for the bad guys (think BONNIE AND CLYE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and possibly even Hannibal Lecter when he snacked on characters we learned to hate).My biggest fear with this series is that it will become the norm. With series like WEEDS where a recently widowed mother becomes a major marijuana dealer or DEXTER where a serial killer becomes a hero for killing bad guys and other serial killers, a trend seems to be starting. And with Hollywood being a place that loves to imitate or repeat past successes with poor quality knock offs, this could turn out to be just the first of many shows like this. Let's just hope that they know it's good and don't move forward with plans on shows about loveable hit men, goofy corrupt politicians or silly next door neighbor pedophiles.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "SO BAD IT'S GOOD", "unixReviewTime": 1268524800, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2010"}, {"reviewerID": "A3M2WW0PO34B94", "asin": "B00150OTCE", "reviewerName": "thornhillatthemovies.com", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewText": "Guillermo Del Toro, the director of \"Pan's Labyrinth\" and \"Hellboy\", seems determined to revive the ghost story. Quite frankly, we need it. Too many `horror' films are excuses for filmmakers to throw buckets of blood and gore at the screen, hurling everything at us in an attempt to see what sticks, or more appropriately, what makes us sick. Gone are the suspense and terror filmmakers like Hitchcock (\"Psycho\"), Robert Wise (\"The Haunting\") and John Carpenter (the original \"Halloween\") who created films with such skill, riveting us to our seats and scaring us away from showers, dark houses and babysitters. Now, `horror' films seem determined to use as many special effects as possible to recreate the goriest, most vial displays. How is this suspenseful or frightening? It is merely sickening.So, it was especially nice to see \"The Orphanage\", a truly creepy, scary ghost story produced by Del Toro and directed by JA Bayona.A brief prologue introduces us to the Orphanage, situated near the ocean. The headmistress takes a phone call and it becomes apparent Laura, who is outside playing with the other five children in the home, will soon be leaving her friends for the comfort of a new family. Many years later, Laura (Belen Rueda), returns to the orphanage with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep). Laura and her husband have purchased the building and are renovating it to care for five or six children \"with special needs\". As the renovations continue, Simon makes a new invisible friend and begins talking with him. This is really nothing new for Laura and Carlos, Simon has other invisible friends, so they aren't really concerned. But when Laura takes Simon down to the beach, and they explore the caves, Laura begins to suspect something is different. During the party, to celebrate the opening of their house, Laura has a run in with a strange child wearing a scarecrow mask and Simon disappears. Laura and Carlos search desperately for Simon, following every lead and looking everywhere. They meet a man who agrees to help and brings in a medium, Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin, Charlie's daughter). Infrared equipment is set up everywhere and they watch Aurora's every move as she tries to communicate with the spirits, the presence she feels. After a particularly harrowing moment, she comes back to the present and tells them they have many spirits roaming the house. Six to be precise. As Laura becomes more and more determined to find Simon, she also begins to unravel the secrets behind the other visitors in the house.\"The Orphanage\" isn't so much about horror, or shock value, as it is about setting the mood for events that will transpire, creating suspense. From the moment Laura, Carlos and Simon return to the orphanage, to set up their home, we know they have made a bad decision. Why would Laura want to return to the orphanage where she grew up, to set up her new home? This seems strange at first. Was she drawn back to this place? Is there some tie with it, making her return? Then, we learn of Laura and Carlos' plan to reopen the home and care for children with development problems and disabilities. Laura wants to give back some of the help and kindness she received as a child, leading her to take on this huge task.As Laura and Carlos go about setting up this house, they try to provide a normal family life for Simon. But Simon has special needs of his own, and they try to deal with, and address these needs. They try to go about their normal activities, but every time they hear a crash, Laura stops and shudders, not from fright, but because some worker somewhere has probably cost her some more money or delay the project. This is a great way for the filmmakers to divert attention, to give us some false chills, and make the real scares even better.As they get settled in, and begin to explore the grounds. Laura tells Simon about the lighthouse just a bit away, and how she and the other children used to find comfort in it's light. She and Simon spend a lot of time together and begin to explore the grounds. One day, as they enter a cave on the beach, Simon tells his mother of his new friend. Laura has clearly heard of other invisible friends in Simon's life and seems to give it little regard, until he runs off and she sees two sets of footprints.When they are ready to open the house to the other children, they throw a party to welcome everyone. But Simon disappears and Laura has a run-in with a child wearing an old smock, like she wore at the orphanage when she was a child. More bothersome, the child is also wearing a burlap mask with a big smile painted on. Who is this child?When they realize Simon is gone, Laura and Carlos put everything else on hold to search for their son.As all of this is going on, I was amazed at how well Bayona maintains the feel of impending horror. The key to this success lies in how realistic everything appears. Laura's impending dread is almost palpable and Rueda does a great job of making her seem real. As the film progresses, the relationship between Laura and Carlos takes some natural turns and develops in a real way.But everything kicks into high gear when the medium, Aurora, played by Geraldine Chaplin, appears. Carlos is reluctant to go along with this, but because he loves his wife, he follows her lead. And Laura is willing to try anything and everything to find their son. Aurora's associates set-up elaborate recording equipment throughout the house. Then, they put her in the old children's bedroom and watch as she tries to communicate with the spirit or spirits in the house. She almost immediately makes contact and begins to walk through the house, trying to find out more about them, about what they need. As Aurora talks to these spirits, we follow her progress as Laura does, watching everything through monitors, the images captured in grainy green infrared monitors. As we follow her progress, we believe she is actually communicating with these spirits and hope she will be able to make some sort of breakthrough.Chaplin does a great job of making this character believable, scary, yet natural. Aurora believes she can communicate with the dead. Because she believes, there is no reason for her to protest when other people doubt. She knows the truth.More importantly, this sequence is all the more effective because we are watching along with Carlos and Laura, as Aurora progresses through the rooms. We don't see ghosts, or spirits materialize out of thin air, we only hear Aurora trying to communicate with them. We only hear what she says, and it is cryptic at best, but it is very effective at making the scene creepy and spine tingling.Then, Laura continues to search and when the truth is finally revealed, we feel everything she feels.I guess, long story - short (I know, too late), what I am trying to say is Guillermo Del Toro is quietly trying to revive the ghost story, the horror film, and wants us to feel the genuine scares and chills behind the characters and the stories.

The television series is shot via single camera and has that drama series style of quality.  But for the most part, the show is anamorphic widescreen and picture quality is satisfactory for what you would expect from television on DVD.As for audio, audio is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1.  For home theater owners with a receiver, the audio is front and channel driven with the dialogue being clear and understandable and the opening theme song coming quite lively.  But for the most part, the audio is satisfactory for a comedy.  Personally, I had my receiver set at stereo on all channels as my primary selection and preference in hearing the series.Subtitles are presented in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"30 ROCK - Season 3' includes quite a number of special features:DISC 1:* Flu Shot Episode Commentary with Tina Fey & Jeff RichmondDISC 2:* Goodbye, My Friend Commentary with Judah Friedlander & John Lutz* The Bubble Commentary with Jon Hamm & Jack McBrayer* Apollo, Apollo Commentary with Jack Burditt & Robert CarlockDISC 3:* The Ones Commentary with Jane Krakowski & Jack McBrayer* Mamma Mia Commentary with Alan Alda* Kidney Now!

The third season showed no signs of slowdown and every episode, you just want to laugh because the characters are hilarious but most of all, the writing is just top notch.  And all 22 episodes in the third season does not disappoint at all.With the second season DVD release from last year, the show was really facing major challenges as the Writers Guild Strike really cut down on the episodes and no one knew if NBC was going to cancel the show but they gave it some time and next thing you know, the show won many awards.  The fact that the show has been nominated for 22 awards in 2009 alone is a testament of how people respect the show's writing and its talent.  As mentioned earlier in my review, \"30 ROCK\" is one of those rare and unique shows on television and everything manages to work perfectly.I've watched Season 3 on television and I couldn't wait to watch the episodes again, that's how much I really enjoy this series.  It's witty, fun and comedy that is highly entertaining!  In fact, as for favorite episodes, there is just so many.  From finding out who Liz Lemon was talking to on the plane ride in the episode \"Believe in the Stars\", to see the reuniting of the \"Night Court\" characters and also see Jennifer Aniston's \"Claire\" getting into mischief in \"The One with the Cast of Night Court\", Kenneth going on a date with a blind staffer with Tracy's help in \"St. Valentine's Day\", Jack seeing a duplicate of himself on the Spanish soap opera in \"Generalissimo\" or Liz and Jack visiting Liz's high school reunion in the episode titled \"Reunion\".  There are just too many fantastic episodes from this third season, that I can't see any fan being disappointed.As for the DVD release of \"30 ROCK - Season 3', this DVD is literally a solid release.  Not only do you get all 22 episodes, 7 audio commentary (and the good news is that they give a variety of talent, even guest stars a chance to take part in the audio commentary) but you also get a good number of other special features that really round out this wonderful DVD release.  Overall, the show is wonderful and the only thing I can hope for is that Universal considers releasing \"30 Rock\" on Blu-ray via High Definition.But there is nothing negative I can say about this release.  It's a solid release and fans of the series will definitely get their money's worth!  \"30 ROCK - Season 3' is highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely fantastic!  Fans of `30 Rock', the third season is another witty, hilarious and highly entertaining season.", "unixReviewTime": 1254355200, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B001EXO256", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [24, 37], "reviewText": "The first two seasons of 30 ROCK the series managed to accumulate every imaginable award, not merely Golden Globes and Emmys, but the highly prestigious Peabody.  TV Critics proclaimed it one of the greatest comedy series in TV history.  Despite all this, no one was watching the series.  NBC renewed it twice simply because it was far and away its most critically acclaimed show.  And as I said, it had a shelf full of awards to prove it.  In accepting the show's first Emmy show creator Tina Fey summed it up perfectly:  \"I'd like to thank our dozens and dozens of viewers.\"Then came the 2008 election and John McCain chose as his running mate a photogenic but outrageously under qualified governor from Alaska.  She was a comically awful choice, but for a while not everyone realized that.  Then on Saturday Night Live Tina Fey returned to portray Sarah Palin.  Her impersonation devastated Palin's public perception and more or less destroyed her political career.  It helped that many of the most hilarious things that she said were incredibly close to what Palin actually said.  While her impersonation was not crucial to McCain's loss, it definitely played a role.  But in addition to the political effects, Tina Fey's Sarah Palin called attention to her and by extension 30 ROCK to a degree not previously possible.  In its third season, 30 ROCK's dozens of fans grew to millions.  NBC suddenly had a hit show.Before going on, we should pause and reflect on this.  Today the networks do not exhibit much patience with shows.  If they are not instant hits, they are canceled.  Even if they get considerable critical acclaim, like PUSHING DAISIES, they will still get canceled.  30 ROCK had survived only because it got such an extreme amount of critical acclaim.  Its critical success more or less tied NBC's hands.  But my point is that after two low rated seasons, the show was a sudden hit.  I wish the networks would keep in mind that great shows always have a chance to become hits.  In fact, they have greater chances than the vast majority of new shows.  Patience with good shows will usually pay off.And what a brilliant show it remained in Season Three.  No doubt their collection of awards will grown once again and it will deserve it.  30 ROCK isn't merely the best comedy show on TV right now, but one of the best ever, possibly the best ever after only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Absolutely everything was perfect.  The writing was simply jaw dropping, with the jokes spilling out at a breathtaking pace.  Most comedy shows pad out the script, pacing the jokes because they don't know if they can keep coming up with the good ones, spacing the jokes with mildly humorous dialogue.  That isn't the way of Tina Fey and her team of writers.  They just assault the viewer with jokes, one right after another.  There are so many jokes that you simply can't keep up with them.  You just can't digest all of them.  What is more, sometimes the jokes are presented not one at a time, but in layers, two or three operating at the same time.  The jokes are verbal and they are also visual.  I still can't get the image of Liz Lemon showing her female friends her yoga pose out of my mind.This is as brilliant a set of characters as has been seen since the Bluth family made their premature exit from television.  Liz Lemon is an absolutely brilliant character, a lead character plagued by feet of clay.  Liz never really does the right thing for the right reason, but at most does the right thing for the wrong reasons.  She might not have an evil bone in her body, but neither does she have a good one.  Much the same is true of the magnificently self-absorbed Jack Donaghy.  Everything he does, no matter how bizarre, is done to further the interests of Jack Donaghy.  And Kevin the Page is one of the most unexpected hit characters on TV.  I'm sure when they started the series they knew he was going to be good, but who knew he would be as good as he ended up?  I'm sure they were confident that Tracy Jordan was going to be a great character, and they were right.  And Jenna Maroney might even surpass Liz and Jack in seeing the world as revolving around herself.  What makes this incredible group of characters even more incredible is that every actor portraying them is extraordinary.  Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply the two best comic performers on TV and together they have created one of the great comic duos in TV history.There were some great comic arcs in Season Three.  Jack has a bizarre and out of character romance with his mother's nurse, played by Salma Hayek.  There is an unexpected glitch in it when her mother hates Jack because of his sharp resemblance to a villain in a Mexican soap (the villain is also portrayed by Alec Baldwin).  Liz persists in her efforts to adopt a child.  She also has a near romance with a very good looking neighbor, played to perfection by Jon Hamm, better known as Don Draper on MAD MEN.  Jenna wears herself out by simultaneously continuing to appear in THE GIRLIE SHOW while starring in an unauthorized biopic based on Janis Joplin (its being unauthorized meaning that in singing the Janis-like songs they can't use the real lyrics, something that leads to excellent results).  In short, hilarity results, again and again.The season ends on a highlight.  Jack learns the identity of his father, who just happens to need a kidney.  Much to his relief, Jack learns that he is not compatible, so they need to find a new donor.  So Jack twists the arms of Elvis Costello and other musicians to do a celebrity single.  The season ends with a group of musicians begging in a video for a kidney for Jack's dad.  Those performing on \"Kidney Now!\" include Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken, Mary J. Bilge, Steve Earle, two of the Beastie Boys, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, Norah Jones (who proudly sings that she is sober), Cyndi Lauper (who confesses that she is not), Sara Bareille, Michael Moby, Michael McDonald, rapper Talib Kweli, Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, Rhett Miller of the Old 97s, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata.  All in all, it is a pretty amazing assemblage of talent for a fake music video.So, once again 30 ROCK was a show that was hitting on all cylinders.  And now the ratings are strong enough that those of us who adore the show don't have to worry that the season that has just ended will be the last.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Should be designated a national treasure", "unixReviewTime": 1244332800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B001F6ZIXC", "reviewerName": "Dennis A. Amith (kndy)", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "\"Sons of Anarchy\" comes from the mind of Kurt Sutter, a former writer and co-producer of FX's popular (and now recently concluded) series \"The Shield\".  Joining Sutter are fellow writers Dave Erickson (\"Canterbury's Law\") and Jack LoGiudice (\"Street Time\", \"Resurrection Blvd.\" and \"7th Heaven\"), composer Bob Theile Jr. (\"The Office\") and cinematography by Paul Maibaum (\"My Boys\", \"Samantha WHO?\" and \"Related\").The drama series revolves around a motorcycle club known as the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO).  With SAMCRO chapters across the country, the original Sons of Anarchy motorcycle club was formed in an area called Charming.  Members consist of normal men who have their own responsibilities, life style and jobs but what they have in common is their allegiance towards the club.  And that allegiance includes being part of a life of danger.  For the Sons of Anarchy, the group makes a lot of money by dealing with importing illegal weapons which they sell to other gangs in the Bay Area (primarily the East Bay area), dealing with other organizations or mafia connections but taking a pride in their city and protecting local businesses and the people of the area.They are well-connected and also have ties to the inside of law enforcement and thus, are able to maintain their operations.  But of course, all is not safe as major gangs are there to cause the club some havoc.  There are those who try to mess with them or steal SAMCRO's shipments such as the white supremacist group known as the \"Nords\", their Latino rivals from Oakland known as the \"Mayans\" and possibly other dangers including the authorities.The first season of \"Sons of Anarchy\" focuses on member Jax (Charlie Hunman, \"Undeclared\", \"Hooligans\"), a member who tends to takes care of operations for the club and is quite respectful of his allegiance to the club that his father John had started and ran until his death many years ago.SAMCRO is now run by Clarence \"Clay\" Morrow (Ron Perlman, \"Hellboy\" films and \"Beauty and the Beast\") who married Jax's mother Gemma (Katey Sagal, \"Married with Children\", \"Futurama\", \"8 Simple Rules...For Dating My Teenage Daughter\") and have lived a life of making money but now are starting to feel the financial constraints.Both have made the Sons of Anarchy to a club that is profitable (due to the club's illegal dealings) but things start to change when Jax discovers his father's belongings especially with the discovery of his dead father's unpublished manuscript.  It appears that his father has envisioned change for the Sons of Anarchy and because of this, Jax notices that with all the trouble and danger the club faces now, perhaps its time to change things for the positive for the club.Jax eventually starts to show doubts towards the club's activities and starts to become more compassionate to the personal lives of some of the members and thus puts himself into a position that can lead to conflict with the his step-father/leader of the Sons of Anarchy.  Of course, this change of thought starts to rub certain members the wrong way, some who question Jax's ability to lead in the future.Needless to say, Jax's mother, Gemma starts to be concerned of her son's interest in her dead husband's belongings and looks at things as if her deceased husband is trying to talk to her son from the grave.  Thus, she wants her husband Clay to make sure that Jax doesn't hurt the operations of the Sons of Anarchy and make sure he doesn't stray.Throughout the series, we get to see how the club operates but most of all how tight or how troubled the internal brotherhood is between the members of the motorcycle club and the dangers they face.Members of the Son of Anarchy also include:* Bobby \"Elvis\" Munson (Mark Boone Junior) - The treasurer of the club and an Elvis impersonator* Tig Trager (Kim Coates) - The sergeant-at-arms.  Clay's right hand man and incredibly violent.  Doesn't believe in Jax as the successor to the club.* Filip \"Chibs\" Telford (Tommy Flanagan) - The medic of the club that served for the British Army.* Piermont \"Piney\" Winston (William Lucking) - Opie's father and co-founder of SAMCRO.* Harry \"Opie\" Winston (Ryan Hurst) - A member of SAMCRO who has been off-an-on with the group because of his obligations to his wife and kids.  Thus he stays away from their illegal activities.* Juan Carlos \"Juice\" Ortiz (Theo Rossi) - The club's intelligence officer, ahe hacker and the guy with the inside connections.* Kip \"Half-Sack\" Epps (Johnny Lewis) -  A member of the club and former Iraq vet.\"Sons of Anarchy - Season One\" is featured on three Blu-ray discs.

The series is a series that has a large number of scenes shot outdoors and for the most part, the picture quality features excellent detail.From the scenery of the mountains, the motorcycles, the weapons, the explosions,  the violent maiming of gangsters and the blood, burnt flesh and details of the wounds are quite clear and detailed on this Blu-ray release.Also, during the darker scenes, I didn't catch any major high compression or high noise during those low-light situations.  Skin tones are natural and you can catch some scenes with the skin pores and for the most part, the picture quality is brilliant although you do see occasional grain but definitely not distracting.Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (Spanish in Dolby Digital).  \"Sons of Anarchy\" is a series that takes advantage of the lossless audio track.  From the revving of the engines of the Harley-Davidson motorcycles to the booms of explosions and the gunshots, the series definitely utilizes the surrounds during those action-scenes.For the most part, the explosions and weapons are minimal and most of the audio is dialogue-driven and is primarily front and center channel driven.  As with the rock music that plays throughout the series.  But for the most part, fans of the series will enjoy the lossless track and its use of the various channels throughout the series.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Sons of Anarchy - Season One\" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:On disc 1, select audio and you will be able to find the following audio commentary:* Commentary for Pilot - Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Guy Feeland, Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal.DISC 2:On disc 2, select audio and you will be able to find the following audio commentary:* Commentary for the Pull - Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Guy Feeland, Maggie Siff and Charlie Hunnam.DISC 3:* Commentary for the Revelator- Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman, Kim Coates, Mark Boone Junior, Theo Rossi, Ryan Hurst, William Lucking, Johnny Lewis and Tommy Flanagan.* The Making of Sons of Anarchy, Season 1 - (8:59) Interviews with the producers, creator and cast about the series.

The interesting thing is that back in the late 1970's, the outlaw life was typically portrayed on television as this hell-bent biker gang but films really never fully explored it well, actually, if anything, they were just used as an episode of \"C.H.I.P.S\" and were people wreaking havoc on innocents.There is a culture among the biker clubs and it was great to see a series that featured characters in a variety of depth and it is quite evident that creator/writer Kurt Sutter did his research well in capturing that culture, the look and feel of the individuals (and of course, great casting) but bringing together this gritty storyline of opposing gangs and rival biker clubs and creating this world where life is not always peaceful and allegiance for the club, you need to sacrifice for the club.  Personally, I was captivated by the storytelling and from beginning to end, realize that hell is going to break loose in Season 2.  Granted, I say this not knowing anything about motorcycle gangs up-close and personal but I would assume with all the time that Sutter spent with the various motorcycle clubs, there are some aspects of that culture that he brought into this fictional drama series.  And of course, that correlation to Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" makes the series quite intriguing.I have to admit that before watching the series, I wasn't sure how Charlie Hunnam (who typically plays popular guy that the girls dig type of roles), Katey Sagal who has been in more sitcom-based shows and more dramatic series and of course, Ron Perlman, an actor that viewers are used to seeing him in \"Hellboy\" or the old classic \"Beauty and the Beast\" series.  But for the most part, each of the talent did wonderful job and the series is literally well-cast.  Hunnam as Jax sans the English accent almost has this Heath Ledger type of feel to his character that works.  Katey Sagal does an excellent job playing a mother, but a mother who has the potential of going bad.  And of course, Ron Perlman definitely has that look of a person you don't want to cross.  Add in the other talent and  overall, the way they play their characters are is convincing.  Again, the talent are definitely well-cast!The Blu-ray further enhances the enjoyment of the series with picture quality really capturing the violence and grittiness of the series.  In the first episode, the first time you lay your eyes on the charred remains of two people, you know that this series is not going to be \"pedestrian\" and by the end of the first episode, you realize that the series is quite violent but fits the situation quite well.  As mentioned before, the lossless audio track definitely compliments the series, especially for those who can't get enough of that engine revving of the Harley's in high definition.  Also, picture quality is well-done and again, as beautiful as the scenery is of the mountain regions and the camera panning through the various Harley's, the picture quality also captures the detail of the violence of the series.\"Sons of Anarchy - Season One\" was definitely a big surprise for me and it's good to know that FX has continued the trend of having well-written, well-cast and overall, another riveting drama series.  Overall, this series is highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A violent, gritty and riveting drama series from Kurt Sutter, writer/producer of \"The Shield\" - Very entertaining!", "unixReviewTime": 1255392000, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A2DAHERP7HYJGO", "asin": "B001GIIRYQ", "reviewerName": "Mark Turner", "helpful": [18, 19], "reviewText": "For five years viewers of television have had the opportunity to watch a show that was interesting, intelligent, motivated at times by the cause of the week and definitely funny as hell. It's too bad that these sorts of shows never seem to catch on with the viewing public. Then again, given network televisions desire for an immediate hit and ridiculous choices to alter their schedules on a whim, it's easy to see why a deserving show might slip through the cracks or be lost amid the weekly shuffle. Such is the case with BOSTON LEGAL.After five seasons on the air, BOSTON LEGAL has closed the doors to the offices of Crane, Poole and Schmidt. Which is too bad for television audiences since another great series bites the dust to only be replaced with the cost effective reality show of the week or perhaps a star vehicle for the pet of some producer. Then again it makes for great news for DVD fans because as well as the show did, it was given the chance to be released on DVD. And this last season just released gives us the chance to savor the episodes from season five like fine wine.For those who have never seen the show, start with season one and catch up or perhaps I could give you a short summation of how the show has evolved. As it opened we were there to see the arrival of up and coming attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) who was coming off of THE PRACTICE, another great law series that ended before it's time. Alan has just taken on a job with the firm and walks into what will become the usual turmoil as one of the senior partners has a breakdown. Get ready because this is the norm.Spader's Alan Shore is a campaigner. He believes in a number of things and is the voice of the writers as they use him to defend the little guy and take on the big guns. Everything from big tobacco to pharmaceutical companies is tackled by Shore by the end of the fifth year. But Shore is not your normal attorney. Instead he is prone to rampant rambling while he pursues the justice he seeks in each battle. He's also a letch of the highest order, viewing nearly every woman he sees as a conquest while at the same time emulating the highest respect for them all.Shore's biggest defender is the firm's high ranking senior partner, Denny Crane (William Shatner). Denny is perhaps the oddest character on the show. A womanizer as well, Denny is so self absorbed with his own fame that he often just says his name aloud with the expectation that in so doing he will intimidate any and all around him, which it usually does. Denny is also affected with what he calls \"mad cow\" disease, the early stages of Alzheimer's. As the show progresses, Denny and Alan become the greatest of friends.Into the fold comes Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen), the voice of reason. Shirley is another senior partner and at one time the love interest of Denny until she broke it off. Shirley stands for the calm voice in the firm, the one who puts their foot down to stop the ridiculous from happening but who rarely sees her expectations met.These are the three mainstays who began from season one and who remained until the end. Their interaction is tremendous, especially the friendship seen between Crane and Shore. Each episode ended with the two of them sitting on Denny's balcony in the office, enjoying a cigar and glass of scotch while they ruminated about things that happened during that episode. As the series progressed, you were witness to the closeness, the bond that developed between the two. Theirs was a unity rarely seen in even the best of marriages. As a matter of fact by the end of season five the pair was petitioning to use the same sex marriage to be joined in wedlock, not out of physical attraction but as a way to circumvent the laws concerning spousal support and decision making as well as current tax laws. These two men genuinely loved one another as much as two friends can.By season five we also had several other main characters involved. John Larroquette was there as Carl Sack, a rather stuffy lawyer and love interest for Bergen's Shirley. His character basically replaced that of Rene Abourjonois who was the bad guy in the beginning (and who returns by the end). But Carl becomes as comfortable a character as the rest by mid-season five, making Larroquette's character another that you would enjoy spending time with.Notable is Christian Clemenson as attorney Jerry Espenson. Suffering from a form of autism, Jerry began as a side character that walked the halls with his girlfriend, a mannequin he addressed as such. He developed into a character with obvious flaws that fought his own personal battles as well as those of his clients. The character came along with ticks and taps and pops, noises and movements he made including clutching his hands to his thighs, but in spite of those problems he was one that we all loved and wanted so much more for.Tara Summers rounded out the main cast members at the end portraying Katie Lloyd, an attorney given the task of assisting Espenson. She also became the object of his affection though he steered clear of letting her know. The usual plot device of sexual tension between two characters was turned on its ear here as the duo often seemed on the verge of actually becoming interested in one another but instead moved in the opposite direction. At least for Lloyd's perspective.All of the lawyers involved in this series were far from the normal lawyers we've become accustomed to over the years as seen on television. They were a quirky bunch who would take on cases ranging from client's whose parents died of cancer cause by smoking to that of an elderly lady attacking the networks for programming shows aimed only at the youth of America while omitting that made for older people, a segment they proved made up the vast majority of viewers. Yes, both of these topics came up in season five and made for interesting viewing.Season five also brought about a number of changes at the firm. Shirley and Carl decided to marry, much to the consternation of Denny who has longed to reunite once more with Shirley. The closeness between Denny and Alan, as noted earlier, became deeper as Denny moved from the early stages of Alzheimer's to a deeper onset. And the romance that had lied deep beneath the surface between Jerry and Katie began to show signs of becoming a reality.All lose ends were tied up nicely with a big bow by series creator David E. Kelly. And new possible threads were put into play when he made the firm about to close and facing bankruptcy. A buy out by the Chinese made for an interesting storyline as did Alan and Denny going before the Supreme Court one more time, the epitome of a lawyer's career, in the hopes of getting Denny the right to use non-FDA approved medication to stave off his disease.Of the characters in this series each offered something special that made you care about them all and want to continue to watch them. To single one out might be considered slighting the rest. But for me, William Shatner deserved the highest accolades for his performance as Denny Crane. Saddled with the mantle of being Captain Kirk for generations of TV and movie viewers and as police office T.J.Hooker for the children of the 80s, Shatner shined as Denny Crane. Never once can you see him here and think of either previous character, a major coupe for an actor to do so. Denny may not always make the right choices, but by the series end, you have to be heartless not to love him.While this may sound like numerous details of the show it falls far short. These were merely some of the high points in twelve episodes that brought the series to its rousing finale. And through it all the cast, crew and writers kept a tremendous sense of humor about it all, often joking through the characters about the end. More than once a character would ask \"Do you think this is a case we should take?\" only to get the response \"Why not, it's our last season\", tongue firmly planted in cheek each time.Who knows how long it will take for a series to reach the heights that this one did. I am sure one will come along. But that right combination of writing, setting, cast and crew is a rarity in today's TV land. Until such time comes along when this happens, make sure you keep BOSTON LEGAL alive. The entire series on DVD is worth owning. And this one, season five, caps off a run that should be talked about for years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THEIR BRIEFS ARE FOLDED", "unixReviewTime": 1244332800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "AD39QGHGWAOPQ", "asin": "B001GRVAUU", "reviewerName": "mwreview \"mwreview\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "American Dad was getting better with every season (or DVD volume) and now it has reached 5 star level.  The reason is that it is consistently clever and well-written.  There are many 5-star episodes here: \"Tearjerker,\" \"Office Spaceman,\" \"Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold,\" \"Spring Break-Up,\" \"The One That Got Away,\" and others that are solid 4-star.  I watch AD as often as I watch Family Guy and South Park.  Watching the episodes from this past season, it has now surpassed FG in writing and storylines.  Stan and Roger rule!  Now, here are the episodes:Disc 1:\"Tearjerker\"--James Bond takeoff where the main characters play different roles except Stan who plays himself, of course.  Roger is \"Tearjerker\" who has a plan to make everyone in the world cry themselves to death.  Can Stan and his new fiance stop him?  A lot of clever one-liners in this one.  My favorite: Francine's character asks Stan for a light and he pulls out a flashlight, \"Looks like you've got yourself a cigarette there.\"  The opening credits are cool.\"Oedipal Panties\"--(Get it? Oedipus?) Stan's mom keeps getting dumped on the third date and she runs to Stan for comfort.  Stan and his mom's disturbingly close relationship and the fates of Stan's mom's boyfriends cause Francine and Roger to investigate.  Roger's fat woman costume is hilarious.\"Widowmaker\"--Francine wants Stan to share things with her like her friend's CIA husband who's gone missing.  When Stan complies, Francine finds out that some things are best kept to one's self.\"Red October Sky\"--Stan's Soviet nemesis before Communism fell (how old is Stan, anyway?) returns a converted Capitalist--until he gets hold of Steve.  Weak ending.  This is my least favorite of this volume.\"Office Spaceman\"--AD redeems itself with this episode. Roger poses as a photographer who has the uncanny ability of taking photos of a certain alien (himself).  He is hired by the C.I.A. to head the Alien Task Force.  Meanwhile, Francine throws out Steve's African American science partner but for different prejudicial reasons than the obvious.  Hilarious episode.  I like when Stan says, \"You have to take this seriously, both of our asses [Bullock walks in]...are equally nice, we both have nice butts.\"Disc 2:\"Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold\"--After a near death experience, Stan is afraid he has left no legacy on the world, so he tears up his property looking for Oliver North's buried gold.  In the meantime, his daughter collects piercings and his son goes steady with a vacuum cleaner.\"Spring Break-Up\"--While Francine is away, Roger hosts an MTV Spring Break party at the Smith's and Stan hangs out with a frat girl who appreciates his jokes and quirks better than his wife.\"1600 Candles\"--Steve's going through puberty and, after the hell they went through with Hayley, Stan and Francine use their C.I.A. connections to postpone or prevent it.  Meanwhile, it's Roger's 1600th birthday and no one cares--well, one scaly friend does.\"The One That Got Away\"--One of Roger's personas has taken on a life of his own and, when he uses Roger's credit card, he experiences Roger's wrath.  Very creative story.  I like the Jimmy Stewart character, Sidney, and his girl Judi with her old school gangster girlfriend accent: \"figgas, I finally find the perfect fella and he's a fig newton of someone's imagination.\"  I was told she is a takeoff of a character on \"The Little Shop of Horrors.\"\"One Little Word\"--Stan becomes Bullock's #1 guy and he can't say no to his orders no matter how much they interfere with his family.  That Cocoa character is funny.Disc 3:\"Choosey Wives Choose Stan\"--(Remember that Jiff commercial?) When Stan finds out Francine was engaged to another man before they met, he fakes his own death to see if Francine will run off with her ex.  Also, Steve keeps being attacked by a stray cat.\"Escape From Pearl Bailey\"--Stan's girlfriend Debbie (is she going to be a regular character?  She just comes and goes) runs for student body president against Lisa Silver.  When she is slandered on the Internet, Steve takes revenge on Lisa and her cronies.  I like when Amy is driving down the hill and it appears Steve cut her brake line, \"Oops, that's the clutch.\"\"Pulling Double Booty\"--Jeff breaks up with Hayley and she goes on a rampage.  To prevent future outbursts, Stan tries to find a man for her who is like himself.  It appears she finds the perfect man in Stan's eyes when she falls for his C.I.A. body double, Bill, until Bill tries to score with Francine.  Now Stan has to pose as Bill to keep Hayley sane.  Meanwhile, Steve has more bad luck with animals.\"The Most Adequate Christmas Ever\"--Know-it-all Stan dies chopping down what he views as the perfect Christmas tree and has to go to court while in Limbo for a second chance.  A silly episode but not terrible.Bonus Features: Deleted scenes that are best kept deleted.  \"Tearjerker: And Then They Will Cry\"--The making of the James Bond episode, how the characters were created, etc. 15 minutes.\"Roger: Master of Disguise\"--Character designers, storyboard revisionists, the supervising director, etc. talk about Roger (my favorite AD character) which includes a discussion on his sxuality.  I like to think that Roger is to AD what Cartman is to South Park.  Cartman is without any moral conscience and therefore opens the door to a myriad of storyline possibilities.  Just as Cartman is capable of the most heinous of acts that anything he does works well with his character, Roger is so crazy that he is capable of getting into all sorts of predicaments and schemes and it works--not to mention all those disguises.  11 minutes.\"Comic Con [2008]\"--Live table reading of \"Pulling Double Booty.\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Nobody needs America's help, until they need it\"--Stan", "unixReviewTime": 1243728000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B001N4PPWK", "reviewerName": "Dennis A.

Sheppard (\"Battlestar Galactica) as James Sterling, Nate's former business partner and now rival. Kari Matchett (\"24', \"Heartland\" and \"Invasion\") as Nate's ex-wife Maggie,  \"Star Trek\" talents Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Armin Shimerman.  And appearances by Lauren Holly, D.B. Sweeney, Sara Rue, Jeremy Roenick and many more.The series would become a major hit for TNT as it became the #1 program on Tuesday nights with solid ratings for the drama series.\"LEVERAGE\" features the following episodes on four discs:Disc 1:* EPISODE 1 - The Nigerian Job - The first episode that shows us how the group came together for the first time.* EPISODE 2 - The Homecoming Job - A military reserve who was filming private military contractors are ambushed by them.  The Reservist who was filming the contractors hires Leverage to get them to pay for his rehabilitation bills.* EPISODE 3 - The Wedding Job - An innocent man died for a mafia boss and the wife of the man wants the money promised to them and hires Leverage for their help.Disc 2:* EPISODE 4 - The Snow Job - A National Guardsman hires Leverage to find justice on the construction firm that foreclosed on his home.* EPISODE 5 - The Mile High Job - A young girl has died due to what may be because of toxic fertilizer.

Will Nate be able to bring everyone together?VIDEO & AUDIO:Overall, \"LEVERAGE\" looks very good for a television drama.  Featured in Widescreen, a lot of scenes are done in the indoors and outdoors and you get many colorful scenes.  Like most drama series on DVD, it's when you get into low light situations and you do see artifacting.  But overall, for a drama series on DVD, \"LEVERAGE\" is stylishly cool in terms of visual appeal.As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround and definitely utilizes the front channels for its explosions and rear surrounds take advantage of action sequences.  I discovered use of LFE as well and overall, for a drama series on DVD, \"LEVERAGE\" sounds great.  Dialog is easy to understand and more than enough action sequences on each episode.Personally, I really hope that Paramount considers a Blu-ray release of \"LEVERAGE\".  There are some really awesome visuals in this series and I can imagine how detailed and excellent this series would benefit from a High Definition transfer.  In fact, I hope Paramount considers it because this series is slick and I can imagine how awesome it would be on HD.  Overall, for a DVD release, audio and picture quality is slightly better than many series on DVD and the fact that there is three episodes instead of the typical four per DVD is a plus on the video end.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"LEVERAGE\" features many special features as each disc has audio commentary for every episode which is magnificent.  The fourth disc is where the majority of the special features are located.  Included on the fourth disc are:* Leverage: Behind the Scenes - (12:40) Dean Devlin shows us behind-the-scenes of the making of \"LEVERAGE\".  Interviews with the talents and crew about their characters and the series.* Anatomy of a Stunt Fight - (3:23) How a stunt scene is rehearsed which includes a fight scene with Christian Kane's character Eliot and Christian discussing his fight scene and preparing for it.* The Cameras of Leverage - (2:14) A featurette primarily on the many cameras used for the filming \"LEVERAGE\".  I don't think I have ever seen a featurette focused on the cameras but film fans, especially those interested in the technical parts of filming will definitely enjoy this feature.* Leverage gets renewed - (2:52) Every talent and crew member gathers for a meeting with Dean Devlin and those who are not present are featured via webcam and placed between each seat of the actors.  Very fun featurette as everyone awaits the big news from TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies Executive Vice President Michael Wright.* Beth Riesgraf's Crazy Actress Spoof - (5:02) Beth Riesgraf vs. the Writers of Leverage.  An interesting spoof starring Beth Riesgraf (who plays Parker) who is a diva actress not so happy that her character has to deliver a zombie baby and taking out her anger at employees.  Very humorous and enjoyable!* Deleted Scenes - The series features two deleted scenes from \"The 12-Step Job\" (3:30) and \"The Second David Job\" (:31).JUDGMENT CALL:From the first episode, I was sold.  I absolutely enjoyed \"LEVERAGE\" and forget about \"Ocean's 11', this drama series features very cool characters, well-written, great locations for filming, witty, smart, stylish and overall, just cool!I was very impressed with the first season and each talent really brings their A game to the series.  Timothy Hutton plays a convincing role as the mastermind of the group; Gina Bellman brings that sexiness that she had in BBC's \"Coupling\" to the series but added depth as a true-to-art con artist; It's great to see Christian Kane again kicking butt since his years on \"Angel\" and also to see the two talents Beth Riesgraf and Aldis Hodge definitely shine in this series.  The characters are well, cast, well-planned, well integrated into the series and I really enjoyed the amount of character development we see in each episode.  Despite being thieves, they are all likeable in their own way.It's one thing to have the typical series special features but \"LEVERAGE\" really goes all out with commentary for each episode and also, the special features that are on this DVD are probably a first (a featurette about the series getting renewed and a featurette on the cameras used on the series) and were quite enjoyable.  Again, I really wish Paramount considers a Blu-ray release of this series.  With its slick production and overall action sequences, I would love to watch it on High Definition.I was pretty surprised to see the amount of technology used in the series but how slick the production is.  All characters are used effectively and each episode was just fun, smart and just enjoyable.  I was very impressed.Overall, this DVD release and the complete series is magnificent and is highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "LEVERAGE is no `Oceans 11', in fact it's way better!

Anyone who is planning on watching this in the winter NBC schedule will not want warnings about what is going to happen.  Those of us who have caught it on DirecTV were delighted and stunned.  I'm going to try to be fairly nonspecific and most of the plot details that I discuss will occur in the first episode, so not much will be revealed.  The review does assume that you've seen Seasons One and Two.  If you have not seen those, this review will contain some spoilers.Season Two of FNL was great, especially the second half of the season, but all in all it was hurt for two reasons.  First, there was the rather melodramatic killing of Tyra's stalker by Landry Clarke.  Pretty close to universally fans objected to this, though most also enjoyed the time that Tyra and Landry were forced to spend together as a result.  Second, the series was hurt by the writer's strike, with the series ending uneasily with Smash being unable to play football for several games.  Other fans complained of Lyla's sojourn as a born again Christian and how whiney Julie was in the first half of the season.  Along the way, however, there has been a host of marvelous storylines.  I gave Season Two five stars without any hesitation, though I also was the first to admit that it wasn't the work of perfection that Season One was.Frankly, based on pure business considerations, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS should have been cancelled at the end of Season Two.  The ratings were just miserable.  And despite every TV critic in America just going crazy over the show (I honestly prefer it to THE WIRE and THE SHIELD), it curiously has not garnered any awards attention.  How is it possible that Connie Britton has not won a couple of Emmys for Best Actress (no one can seriously tell me that Sally Field has been a better television actress than Britton over the past two years)?  Why no awards for Kyle Chandler?  Why has Adrianne Palicki's astonishing work as Tyra Collette gone unrecognized by the awards?  Omissions like this are an indictment of the awards themselves.  And why has FNL not received two straight nominations for Best Drama?  It is simply absurd that it has not.Miraculously, NBC did something uncharacteristic for a major network:  it found a way to save a show that deserved saving.  They worked a deal with DirecTV to show the 13 episodes of Season 3 in the fall of 2008 with NBC showing the show in the winter of 2009.  Kudos to NBC!  I have been horrified by some recent decisions by the majors.  How ABC could even have considered canceling a masterpiece like PUSHING DASIES, let alone doing it, is simply inconceivable.  And how NBC, despite the very good thing it did in saving FNL, imagines that it is doing quality TV a service by gutting five hours of scripted TV next year so that we can get stuck with the repellant Jay Leno is unimaginable.  Still, I wish more networks would take the effort that NBC did to save their best shows.Right now there is no word on whether there will be a Season Four of FNL.  My assumption is that after some of the ratings for the winter come in, NBC and DirecTV will sit down and figure out whether they want to do this again.  If they do, the format is difficult to predict.  There are a few major changes on the show, but within specifying what those are, there will clearly need to be a decision as to whether to stick with the kids who have graduated from Dillon High or keep Coach Taylor in high school football with a new group of players.  Personally, I've been hoping that the main kids go to the same college, where Taylor will be named the new head football coach.  But if there is no Season Four, they have left Season Three in a place to where it can serve as a series finale.  The final two episodes are brilliant summations of everything wonderful that we've cared about for three years.Season Three is, in my opinion, the best yet.  Nearly ever major character has some wonderful story arcs.  Because of budgetary considerations and also perhaps the pressure of giving all the characters enough time with only 13 episodes, two major characters has to be written out of the show, though each one gets a several-episode arc to say goodbye.  Those two are Smash Williams and Jason Street.  Given that both have graduated from Dillon, this was a logical change.  Also apparently for reasons of time and budget Santiago, who in Season Two was living with Buddy Garrity, simply disappears with no comment.  But the other familiar are back.  Season Two ended with Tim Riggins ardently pursuing Lyla Garrity, Tyra and Landry dating as an official couple, and Julie pining for Matt.  All those relationships get shaken up (though I won't say in what ways).  But nothing is so completely shaken up as Coach Taylor's involvement with the new school principal.  And nothing is so funny as the new principal coming to terms with two simple words, \"Jumbo Tron.\"I especially enjoyed Tyra's arc in Season Three.  If you rewatch Season One of FNL, it is clear that early on they didn't quite know what to do with Tyra.  Adrianne Palicki, who plays Tyra, is an amazing beauty with incredible onscreen charisma, but for the first three-quarters of Season One she is just in the show simply because she is.  She is not integrated into any of the show's major storylines.  But once Tami Taylor takes an interest in her (fascinatingly, just shortly after she had forbade her daughter to be friends with her), we get one of the best stories of an individual coming to desire a better life and doing something to achieve it that I've ever seen on TV.  And I'll slightly break my promise not to reveal any spoilers by stating that one of the entire highlights in all of FNL comes in the next to last episode where Tyra reads aloud her college application essay.  It is as moving a moment as you'll encounter on television and it also marks just how far Tyra's character has come since Season One.  And along with Tyra you get her endlessly fascinating relationship with Landry Clarke.  If you don't like their relationship one week, check back the next.  The tension between his never ceasing adoration of her and her flittering back and forth between valuing him for all his outstanding qualities and her reign as the queen of mixed signals produces many of the show's best moments.  And any conversation that the two actors have is special.This is a season filled with surprises, a plethora of marvelous small moments, a few heartbreaks, and a few shocks.  I've gotten about eight or nine people to watch this show and every one of them has become a passionate lover of it.  If you already love the show, you'll love this great, great and hopefully not final season as much as the first two.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Season Yet of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS", "unixReviewTime": 1231891200, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B001SE07JG", "reviewerName": "Dennis A. Amith (kndy)", "helpful": [9, 10], "reviewText": "Intriguing, original and cool!  Joss Whedon's \"dollhouse\" Season 1 is an enjoyable series that manages to captivates your attention form beginning to end.In 2009, Joss Whedon returned to television with his fourth television show (since \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, \"Angel\" and \"Firefly\") known as \"dollhouse\".The series received quite a bit of promotion for FOX and also became a series that featured less commercials (television spots were sold at a premium) and generated hype among many fans online who preferred to watch the series on [...].Needless to say, it was a series that didn't have the greatest of ratings but as of right now, FOX has greenlighted a second season.Here is a spoiler-free synopsis of what to find on \"dollhouse\" season 1:DISC 1:* Episode 1 - Ghost - We are introduced to \"Echo\" who is imprinted as a hostage negotiator and must save a child who has been kidnapped.  We are introduced to Topher Brink (Fran Kranz) who is the intelligent hacker responsible for imprinting the dolls and other key players who work for dollhouse and the various dolls that Echo interacts with.* Episode 2 - The Target - Echo has been imprinted as a date for a wealthy businessman.  What she doesn't know is that the businessman is a killer.  Meanwhile, an active named Alpha has somehow gone crazy and murdered many staff and dolls inside the facility.  Also, Echo meets her new handler Body Langton (Harry J. Lennix).* Episode 3 - Stage Fright - Echo has been imprinted as a backup singer for a pop diva who has been having problems with an obsessed fan.* Episode 4 - Gray Hour - Echo has been imprinted as a high tech thief.* Episode 5 -True Believer - Echo has been imprinted as a member of a religious cult but her goal is to infiltrate the area.Disc 2:* Episode 6 - Man on the Street - Something has gone wrong with active Sierra (Dichen Lachman) which leads Boyd to do an investigation.  Meanwhile, Echo comes into contact with Agent Ballard.* Episode 7 - Echoes - A psychotropic drug is released in a college research lab and all actives must work together to find out who stole the drug.* Episode 8 - Needs - Actives Echo, Sierra, Victor and November are somehow freed from their pods and try to escape the Dollhouse.* Episode 9 - Spy in the House of Love - DeWitt is away on business travel and Topher finds a chip and alerts Head of Security, Lawrence Dominic that there is a spy within the Dollhouse.* Episode 10 - Haunted - A wealthy woman named Margaret has been uploading her personality to the dollhouse every month because she feels that she may be murdered one day.  When that day comes, Echo is imprinted with her memories and now must find the person who is responsible Margaret's death.Disc 3:* Episode 11 - Briar Rose - Agent Ballard and a hacker named Stephen Kepler sneak into the Dollhouse to free Echo.* Episode 12 - Omega - Stephen Kepler turns out to be Alpha and has kidnapped Echo. Now Agent Ballard has no choice but to team up DeWitt and Boyd in order to find Echo.Also, included on Disc 3 are two episodes.  The first is a pilot which was created and not aired on television.  The pilot features storyline elements that were featured as flashbacks in other episodes and thus was not aired on television.  As for episode 13, the following was created in order for Joss Whedon to meet the 13-episode on a DVD release quota and was not aired on television (but was aired at San Diego Comic-Con 2009).  Also, in case if the series was canceled, episode 13 offered insight to the future of the Dollhouse and an ending for fans.  If not, then the episode would tease of a future to come.* Pilot Episode - Echo - The introduction to Echo and her joining the Dollhouse.* Episode 13 - Epitaph One - In 2019, something terrible has happened and it seems the technology from the Dollhouse has been misused by the Rossum Corporation and used by another country on its citizens and eventually leading to an apocalyptic storyline where mankind and those who have been imprinted are at war.VIDEO & AUDIO:\"Dollhouse\" receives its High Definition transfer and is featured in 1080p (Widescreen 1:78:1).  As with many television series on DVD or Blu-ray, one thing that becomes evident is digital artifacting due to compression.  Some series on Blu-ray have been quite exceptional but those series are typically highly popular series with a tremendous budget.  The good news is that \"Dollhouse\" does look very good compared to how it looked on television and even on HD via online.  Outdoor scenes are quite vibrant, detail can be seen onscreen quite easily from closeups of the talents faces, wounds and even the Dollhouse living area.  Blacks are solid and skin tones are natural.The bad news is that for a television series, there is a sign of softness (which probably comes from use of DNR - digital noise reduction).  There is also compression artifacts that show up on video with red backgrounds and for a Blu-ray release, while it does look very good, it doesn't look great.  But its hard to tell if this was because there are five episodes on one disc (other series on Blu-ray try to have four episodes and utilize the entire disc for picture and audio quality).  Granted, I may be a bit nitpicky when it comes to this but by the series does look very good, but somehow I felt it could have been much better and less soft and waxy at times.As for audio, the series is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The series is dialogue and musical driven, thus the majority of the series is mostly utilized on front and center channels.  Surround channels are utilized in certain action scenes with gunshots or even the sound made at the end of the episode, really sound good on HD.  But for the most part, although there are action sequences when it comes to people fighting, this is not a series that utilizes many explosions or intense action sequences.Also, its important to let people know that for a series that does utilize quite a bit of music, especially in the first episode, the music from the series is kept and not changed for the Blu-ray or DVD release.  Dialogue and music are crystal clear and understandable.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"dollhouse\" features quite a few special features.  Included are:* Audio Commentaries - Certain episodes on each disc contain audio commentary.  Personally, I didn't like how the audio commentary section was prepared on the menus because you have to select an individual episode and by a click of the button, it will either start the episode or give you an option of audio commentary.  So, it would have been nice if there was a way to find out which episode had audio commentary via an insert or even on back of the cover.  With that being said, the following episodes have commentary:  \"Ghost\" features director Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku, \"Man on the Street\" and \"Epitaph One\" featuring Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen.  First, let me say that the commentary for each of these are hilarious and enjoyable to listen to.  For \"Ghost\", Joss and Eliza tend to have fun and really do not get to technical on how scenes were created and are more like buddies.  On the other hand, Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen are quite interesting. The two real-life married couple discuss  certain scenes and informative behind-the-scenes information but also tell a lot of jokes.  And for a first in commentary, it's the first time I have ever heard a couple ask for sex for later in the night.  For the most part, the commentary is just fun to listen to and for a episode like \"Epitaph One\", you hear how that episode had to be made on a short budget and who knows where it would lead to in the second season.* Making Dollhouse - (20:47) Featured in High Definition.  Although the commentary is not technical, Joss Whedon definitely gets technical with this featurette.  You learn everything in regards tot he creation of \"dollhouse\".

Featured in HD.JUDGMENT CALL:\"dollhouse\" is an enjoyable series.  As a fan of Joss Whedon's work (television, film and comic books),  you literally know that you're in for a treat.  I've always thought that how his mind works, many of us who enjoy his work know that these storylines that can look incredible on television but also on film. His utilization of characters and character development is just quality.\"dollhouse\" is a series that eventually gets better and better with each episode.  In a way, I think it works that there are 12-episodes as opposed to the Buffy and Angel years that had nearly two dozen.  This allows for less filler episodes and getting to the focal point of the storyline of \"dollhouse\" about Echo being a special kind of active, Agent Ballard trying to bring down the Dollhouse and of course, a rogue active named Alpha who wants to go further and destroy those who work at the Dollhouse and use the technology for other means.There are many characters in the series but with each episode, they are carefully integrated to each episode and amongst the development for each character, you get to know enough backstory to have interest in them.Also, Whedon's future apocalyptic storyline definitely was intriguing.  I will say that the bonus 13th episode \"Epitaph One\" definitely has exciting plans for the future and although the episode may have been created just in case the series is canceled, nevertheless it opens a potential of a future that is quite exciting and not sure if that storyline will be part of season two.Overall, I really enjoyed Joss Whedon's \"dollhouse\".  Each episode is well-written and enjoyable, especially as the series progresses.  I really hope the series makes it through its five year plan.As for the Blu-ray release, the Blu-ray features a good number of bells and whistles to make this season worth owning.  Granted, this is not the most beautiful looking television series on High Definition but the series looks great and you definitely get your money's worth with this release.Overall, Joss Whedon's \"dollhouse\" Season One is a wonderful series to own.

Bala \"Me Too Can Read\"", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewText": "One of the most enduring urban legends in Los Angeles is that of the Dollhouse, an underground establishment which traffics in wish fulfillment. Rumor is that the Dollhouse programs its people (a.k.a. \"Dolls\" or \"Actives\") with imprinted personalities and skills, to be whoever or whatever the Dollhouse's incredibly powerful and wealthy clientele desires them to be. When not on assignment, it's said that these dolls are kept in a placid zombified state, their original personalities having been erased. Some urban legends are true.The Dollhouse exists, and its influence reaches far and reaches deep. While its steely lady Director espouses an altruistic motivation, sinister elements have surfaced to gainsay this. The elephant in the room is Alpha, a doll who inexplicably went berserk during his dormant state and murdered a group of defenseless dolls and other Dollhouse functionaries. The only doll to survive Alpha's killing spree is Echo. And, as we learn, there's something very special about Echo. Alpha supposedly perished at the hands of Dollhouse's security. Supposedly.Another running subplot focuses on federal agent Paul Ballard who from the opening episode is already obsessed with unearthing and exposing the Dollhouse. For a chunk of this season, though, he spends time groping in the dark and being derided by his fellow agents. Meanwhile, shadowy forces seek to bring down the Dollhouse and they show no scruples in using Ballard as a pawn.- Head programmer Topher, to Echo's new handler Boyd: \"So what do you think of your new girl?\"- Boyd: \"She's not a girl. She's not even a person. Just an empty hat. Until you stuff a rabbit in it.\"Echo is the key, the central character of the story. Piece by piece, little by little, there's a breaking down in the Dollhouse's programming and several of the dolls begin to act outside their established parameters. The most curious of all the dolls, Echo demonstrates a more focused resistance. She begins to fight her programming, as stray memories from her past life and from her past imprints begin to seep back in. Season one's fourteen episodes chronicle Echo's evolution from tabula rasa to someone who regains a measure of independence and self-awareness. Just how much does she regain? What are the repercussions, to her and to the Dollhouse?  Adelle DeWitt, the lady Director, proclaims: \"This House is out of balance.\" The second season finds the Dollhouse still teetering on collapse. It makes for awesome, gray-area'd television.A sigh of relief for me, when I found out that DOLLHOUSE is getting picked up for a second season. I wasn't sure or that hopeful, since the ratings weren't at all impressive. I noticed - hell, everyone noticed - that DOLLHOUSE seemed to have trouble finding its groove. The first five aired episodes are pretty much standalone tales and, with the possible exception of \"Gray Hour,\" lacking in that \"Gotcha!\" punch. With the sixth episode \"Man on the Street,\" things finally start rolling, and the overarcing story really begins to build momentum. It's all good from there on, with Joss Whedon, it seems, having finally found clarity and able to move forward with the constructing of the Dollhouse mythology.A smattering of propers for the lead. Sexy. Sensuous. A whiff of something dangerous, rebellious. A very good actress. Is convincing when she talks smack. Can even sing. Is it heresy to admit that I find Eliza Dushku more of a turn-on than Sarah Michelle Geller? \"She has that thing. She never didn't have that thing.\" is what Joss Whedon said about Eliza Dushku. Those expecting DOLLHOUSE to be a straight-up action thriller may be disappointed; it isn't that kind of show, strictly. You really don't get a steady diet of Eliza Dushku whuppin' on bad guys, although, don't get me wrong, there are some skull cracking moments. But Echo doesn't always get the ninja/super spy/assassin implant (sometimes it's fellow Actives Sierra or November tapped for the fisticuffs). Dushku, and the other actors playing dolls, get challenged each episode as they put on different hats, assume various avatars. Echo, when not a good-natured vegetable, in turn becomes an asthmatic hostage negotiator, a dominatrix, a cocky thief, a blind cultist, a backup singer, the perfect girlfriend, and even a dead woman who comes back to solve her own murder. That's a whole range of emotions and attitudes and character shifts. Eliza Duskhu pulls it off. However, I find that Echo, as a blank slate, is when she's at her most likeable. She exudes sweetness and a childlike innocence. Come to think of it, the same applies for the other dolls. We wonder what these characters are really like, at their core. And, so, when the dolls begin interacting with each other, that's when the show really gets interesting.The rest of the cast are uniformly very good, but I just have to point out the remarkable Tahmoh Penikett (FBI agent Paul Ballard). Penikett exudes a commanding presence, physical and intense and yet sort of soulful. Plus, his Muay Thai training comes in very handy in his action sequences. In fact, the best fight scene in this season of DOLLHOUSE happens in \"Man on the Street\" as Ballard takes on Echo in a no-holds-barred skirmish. I will admit that, in the first few episodes, I found his story arc plodding as guy wasn't getting anywhere on his case. But then again, as implied, those first few episodes came off as slow and muddled.In the tradition of John Ford and Orson Welles, Joss Whedon likes to hire actors he'd worked with before. Alan Tudyk (FIREFLY) and Felicia Day (DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG) have guest starring parts. In Season 2, Summer Glau is slated to have a recurring role. The show, however, may have to deal with losing Amy Acker (ANGEL and the horribly scarred Dr. Claire Saunders in this one). It looks like her pilot HAPPY TOWN was picked up by ABC.Not unexpectedly, this show reeks of many dark themes. Themes of paranoia and conspiracy, of sexuality and objectification and of just what is it that makes up one's sense of identity, and of technology abused. And, of course, it's a morality play. Joss Whedon intended DOLLHOUSE to be thought-provoking, controversial, and at times uncomfortable, and he succeeds on all counts. Part of the intrigue is that you never quite know what kind of episode you're going to get. Sometimes, it's got this romantic air about it. Sometimes, it's funny. Sometimes, it's pretty creepy and appaling. Your perceptions are effed with. Each further episode peels away layer after layer. At some point you realize that you can't believe a lot of what you see on the surface. Joss Whedon relishes playing his Jedi mind tricks on the television audience.I've got my preferred episodes, although I heartily recommend anything from \"Man on the Street\" and on. But, yes, \"Man on the Street\" is very good. To me, that's when Joss Whedon finally finds his sea legs and begins to amp things up. \"Needs\" gives us a glimpse of some of the dolls' true personalities. \"Omega\" at last unleashes Alpha, who is a seriously deranged em-effer and who can access all his past imprints. \"Epitaph One,\" one of the two unaired episodes, is set in a bleak post-apocalyptic future in which the Dollhouse technology had been set loose onto the world, and where the Imprints hunt down humans with intact personalities. Joss Whedon filmed \"Epitaph One\" because the network required a thirteenth episode and also because Joss intended this one to serve as either a teaser for future story arcs or as the capper to the series, should the worst happen. Meanwhile, the third episode aired, \"Stage Fright,\" is worth checking out for Eliza Dushku's singing in one scene.Bonus features time. This Season One set comes in 4 discs and presents all twelve episodes, plus two unaired episodes (both of which are on disc 4): \"Epitaph One\" and the original pilot \"Echo\" (some of the scenes in \"Echo\" are integrated into the aired episodes, but there's enough never-before-seen material to make it worth watching - but you could see where the episode needed tightening up); audio commentary for three episodes: \"Ghost\" (with Joss Whedon & Eliza Dushku - really fun), \"Man on the Street (with Joss Whedon), and \"Epitaph One\" (with Joss's brother Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, the happy couple who wrote the teleplay and who in their commentary track sometimes engage in playful lovey-dovey talk - also really fun); a whole gang of brief deleted scenes from nine of the episodes (my favorites of which are those depicting Sierra and November as bounty hunters in \"Omega\").Disc 4 also has these following featurettes: \"Making DOLLHOUSE\" is around 20 minutes long and offers insights into the casting choices and the two pilots made, as well as a look at \"Epitaph One\"; \"Coming Home\" - this is almost a reunion featurette, 7 minutes of Joss Whedon's staff warmly expounding on how glad they are to be working with him again; \"Finding Echo\" is about the magic of a hot Gouda pizza and of Joss and Eliza's friendship and how that led into their collaboration in DOLLHOUSE (5 minutes long); \"Designing the Perfect DOLLHOUSE\" is Joss giving a 6-minute tour of the amazing Dollhouse set; and \"A Private Engagement\" - the cast and crew share their thoughts on Dollhouse imprinting and, hey, is Joss Whedon a doll? (almost six minutes long).So, to boil it all down (because I don't really know how to end this thing)... DOLLHOUSE is about: Broken people desperate for an escape. It's about an urban legend. A shadow corporation. Some worrisome place called the Attic. A psychopathic doll. A whiff of romance, probably doomed. A determined, much maligned FBI agent. It's also about espionage and martial arts, and playing God and are emotions real as long as you feel them wholeheartedly even if they're programmed into you? And it's about co-ed showers. DOLLHOUSE is Joss Whedon masterminding a reality-warping thriller and his messing with our minds but making us like it. DOLLHOUSE is Eliza Dushku asking us: \"Who do you want me to be?\" So sit down. Tune in. Make yourself uncomfortable. It's time for your treatment.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "\"Definitely feeling kinda lab ratty here.\"", "unixReviewTime": 1252281600, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A16QODENBJVUI1", "asin": "B001SE07JG", "reviewerName": "Robert Moore", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewText": "Over the past fifteen years, no one has made more interesting television than Joss Whedon.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER helped revolutionize television, not only making the empowered female hero a staple of television, but popularizing the long story arc and introducing the concept of the body count.  ANGEL did little innovation in its own right, but still managed to roll out several seasons of excellent and consistently fascinating television.  And FIREFLY not only brought new ground by blending the Western and Sci-fi, but brought a grittiness to the genre that later BATTLESTAR GALACTICA took to new heights.  DOLLHOUSE, however, is both a far more challenging and adventurous series than any of these.  Is it as consistently successful as these?  Absolutely not.  Does it represent Joss Whedon's best work?  Here the answer gets dicey.  Speaking strictly on the basis of what has been shown so far the answer would be \"No,\" but a more honest and accurate answer would be, \"Potentially.\"It is no secrete that DOLLHOUSE is considered a long shot to be renewed.  The fault largely has to be laid at the feet of the executives of FOX.  This show, unlike virtually every other show that FOX has ever done, is cutting edge and adventurous, taking risks unlike anything else you'll find on commercial TV.  Had the show been placed on any night of the week other than Friday it unquestionably would have attracted a healthy viewership.  After all, there is no question that a large number of people are actually watching it.  Between live viewers on the \"death night\" of Friday, the large number of people who DVR the show, the huge number of people who download it via Torrents, and those who buy it on iTunes or Amazon's Unbox, a whole lot of people watch this show.  But FOX shoved the show into the least promising time slot of the entire week, Friday nights.  And what was the result?  What anyone would imagine it would be:  no one watched it live.  DVR?  Yes.  Download?  Yes.  But live?  No.  The problem with Friday nights is that everyone in the 18-49 age group that advertisers desire is that they are all out doing stuff.  The shows that have good ratings that night, like GHOST WHISPERER, attracts primarily viewers over the age of 49.  FOX is responsible for the low ratings of DOLLHOUSE by not putting it on a better night.  But despite that it has a show that plenty of people are watching, only not live.DOLLHOUSE is built around an extremely difficult concept:  people voluntarily (though not uncoerced) agreeing to become more or less indentured servants (which also involves nothing short of prostitution).  Imprinted with the personalities who anyone needed for their jobs, the \"Actives\" who populate the Dollhouse can undertake virtually any job imaginable, for a fee.  The first several episodes were somewhat slow and dragged a bit, a series of standalone episodes strongly encouraged by FOX.  But once the show moved away from the \"assignment of the week\" it became the most bracing and exciting hour on television.  The second half of the season featured one absolutely breathtaking episode after another, culminating in the final two, where the mysterious \"Alpha\" finally put in an appearance (played by the wonderful Alan Tudyk) makes his appearance.  The show featured one startling twist and shock after another, some that could be anticipated (like many, I had guessed something crucial about Amy Acker's character)) and others that could not.  It became a show that was the least predictable on TV.The question now is whether FOX will allow us to find out what happens next.  Due to their terrible decision to put the show on Friday nights the ratings bombed (the original plan was to put the show on Mondays just before 24), which is unfortunately still the only came in town for the networks and advertisers, despite the otherwise large number of people who watch the series.  I do have one hope for the continuance of DOLLHOUSE as we know it.  Kevin Reilly, the head of FOX since the summer of 2007, has not been out-of-control in canceling shows.  Unlike the FOX of the past, the Kevin Reilly FOX has been far more sober in canceling shows (though he has inexplicably renewed what is arguably the most hated show on TV, `TIL DEATH, which has the lowest viewer rating of any active show on TV).  While head of NBC, Reilly made a habit of renewing critically acclaimed but low-rated series, like 30 ROCK, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and THE OFFICE.  Two of those three later became hits.  My hope with DOLLHOUSE is that Reilly will remember that great shows have a potential of growing an audience, if you put them on the right night.DOLLHOUSE is one of many shows of recent years that focuses extensively or even primarily on the question of what makes a person.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, for instance, dealt at length about who could be said to be a person.  In the first three seasons of that show Sharon Agathon (who was, interestingly, involved with Karl Agathon, who was played by Tahmoh Penikett, who plays FBI agent Paul Ballard on DOLLHOUSE) is at the center of whether or not she is a person, despite being a cybernetic machine.  Living in a world where our self-identities are often the construct of the things that we identify with and purchase, products of the consumer society in which we live.  Questions of authenticity are at the heart of our society.  If you know many of the thinkers and writers with whom Joss Whedon is familiar there is no question that he is familiar with these kinds of issues.  Many are not comfortable with this.  Whedon made his mark as one of the great feminists on television (and interestingly DOLLHOUSE stars Eliza Dushku, whose mother, like Whedon's, is a well known feminist).  He has taken a lot of flak for the prostitution that the \"Dolls\" on the show engage in.  The women are very much victims and there are few images of empowered women, completely unlike BUFFY with Buffy and Willow, ANGEL with Fred and Cordelia, and FIREFLY with River and Zoe.  But the world is messy and complex and heavily nuanced.  This show interacts and dialogues with that complexity.  We are having a crisis of identity.  We allow too many influences in society dictate who we are.  How can we be authentic human beings when we do not have control over our own personhood?  These questions transcend issues of feminism and penetrate to the question of what it means to be a person.Although there may not be a Season Two of DOLLHOUSE, Joss Whedon has produced a wonderfully self-contained series even if it doesn't continue.  Unliked the vast majority of TV creators and writers, Whedon has always felt that each season of a series should end in a way so that if it is the last episode, fans aren't left unnecessarily suffering.  The final episode of ever season of every show he has done has not ended on a cliffhanger unless the show had already been renewed before production on the finale had begun.  Seasons One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven of BUFFY as well as Seasons One, Two, Four, and Five of ANGEL could all serve as series ends.  They already knew that ANGEL had been renewed when the finale of Season Three was filming.  FIREFLY was cancelled right in the middle of filming, so it never had the opportunity of any kind of ending.The DVDs will feature an episode that FOX currently has no plan on broadcasting.  It guest stars Felicia Day (one of the Potentials from Season Seven of BUFFY and the love female lead in DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG) and purportedly does some exceptionally over-the-top things.  Kristin of Eonline has reported that if FOX does not renew DOLLHOUSE, Joss Whedon is interested in developing a new show out of that final though unbroadcast episode of DOLLHOUSE.  Hopefully, this time he will try to do something on one of the cable networks.  Instead of FOX, I would like to see him on the Sci Fi channel (or as it is soon to be known, SyFy) or HBO or Showtime or even AMC.  Because we haven't seen this episode yet, we have no idea what direction a new Joss Whedon series based on this would look like.  But if it is even a fraction as interesting as DOLLHOUSE, I am game.  The truth is, this show should never have been on FOX to begin with.  That it did was a result of Eliza Dushku having a contract with FOX to develop a new show.  She immediately asked Joss Whedon to create that show.  I think she has done a great job as Echo in the series, but I hope that we'll continue to see her either on FOX in this show or on a cable channel in the same role on a new show.Will this be the end of DOLLHOUSE?  I hope not.  I had grown to have almost no interest in FOX and hadn't been watching any FOX shows in several seasons, but first with TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES and then with DOLLHOUSE and FRINGE, I thought it was finally becoming a network that was interested in exciting and complex programming.  And maybe it will be.  Time will tell.  But here is what confuses me.  There is no shortage of great series on TV.  But so many of those shows are lightly watched.  Some are on cable and as a result are sheltered by lowered expectations.  MAD MEN, BREAKING BAD, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and TRUE BLOOD are all interesting or even great shows that get very few viewers, far less than even failing shows on CBS or NBC or ABC.  Then there are more heavily watched shows like PUSHING DAISIES, ELI STONE, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, CHUCK, and DOLLHOUSE that either get cancelled or are in danger of cancellation because they are on one of the broadcast networks.  There is no question that the television industry is broken.  Viewership is in decline for all the networks for all evenings.  There is little to indicate that this is going to reverse.  But the networks have not managed to come up with any kind of functional model to deal with lessened viewership.  FOX can't figure out what to do with shows like TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES and DOLLHOUSE that are heavily watched but have few live viewers.  If FOX cancels them, in their place will go two other shows with perhaps even fewer viewers and far less critical buzz.Whatever happens, we at least got one splendid season of the always-fascinating Joss Whedon.  Hopefully we'll get more seasons of DOLLHOUSE.  If not, more seasons of some new Joss Whedon series.May 15, 2009 -- Awesome news!!!!  Against hope FOX has renewed DOLLHOUSE  for a second season!  The Hollywood Reporter broke the story but it has since been confirmed by some writers on the show.  It has been renewed for only 13 episodes, which is similar to what has happened to CHUCK and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  But unless one wants to quibble with the number of episodes, this is great news.  The one fly in the ointment is that FOX is apparently keeping the show on Friday night.  It seems that they have decided to keep a show going that a core group of people care passionately about rather than a show that might get slightly more viewers, but who don't care that much one way or another.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the most inventive, challenging shows on television", "unixReviewTime": 1241740800, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A3M2WW0PO34B94", "asin": "B001TNVEKC", "reviewerName": "thornhillatthemovies.com", "helpful": [4, 10], "reviewText": "I was extremely disappointed by \"The Great Buck Howard\".The Great Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is a stage performer way past his prime.  A mentalist, he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading, hypnotism and other mental games. The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience, while still very enthusiastic, is aging and dwindling. In his heyday, he appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\" sixty three times, a fact he mentions repeatedly, and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard, a title he has determinedly kept ever since. Preparing for his big comeback, his business manager (Ricky Jay) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager. Troy Gable (Colin Hanks, son of Tom) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer. But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills, so he interviews to work with Buck. He gets the job and heads out with the performer, making sure Buck's every request is filled, that the venues have everything set up, stagehands are ready to go, and the like. The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such. Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new \"The Tonight Show\" and plans a big stunt, guaranteed to kick-start his comeback. He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist. Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt, \"Sunshine Cleaning\", \"The Devil Wears Prada\") shows up and begins to set everything in place. But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly, \"The Great Buck Howard\" misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable. It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self-perceived fame and glory. Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts, \"I love this town,\" and he really seems to mean it. He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience. But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show. Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we can't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny. We have seen this type of character before. Many times. And many of these performances have been more insightful, more daring and more interesting.For \"Buck Howard\" to work, we need to realize the character knows his career is fading. He doesn't seem to. He enjoys the shows so much, you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun. In fact, much of the time, he seems to be trying to make Troy's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self-aware. If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing, are we supposed to either laugh at or with, or feel empathy towards him? He isn't desperate enough and enjoys what he does, even on a smaller scale, too much.Colin Hanks is OK, but he spends most of the time standing to one side, observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression. The only clues we seem to get come from his narration. And his narration never seems to stop, rambling on and on. Film is a visual medium, a visual art form, so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading. Narration is useful and necessary in some instances. It isn't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen, when we can't tell this visually. At least it shouldn't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film, both bad. In \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\", Woody Allen uses an omniscient (and ever present) narrator to tell us the feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen. It quickly grates on the viewer's nerves. Worse, the narrator isn't even a character in the story. It's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes. The narration in \"Buck Howard\" seems designed for a different purpose. In many low budget, independent films, a narrator provides a useful tool. They tell us about things, bridging the gap in the stories, saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed. I generally overlook this, because it isn't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film. In \"Buck Howard\", I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons, to help show things they couldn't afford to film, but Hank's descriptions go beyond this. They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling, thinking, want to do and accomplish. Why aren't we seeing this in the characters themselves? Why do we have to be told this?Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film. He stands to the side a lot, observing, watching, rarely speaking. When he does, he always seems kind of flat, as though he can't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions. I can't help but think how much different his father's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt's Valeria shows up, Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship. Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air. Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation. From New York, it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world. She moves faster, registers faster, reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town. As soon as she meets Troy, she begins to flirt with him (she must see something we don't) and he picks up on it, relishing the new relationship. At one point, Valerie can't help but laugh at one of Buck's statements, providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck's official hosts in Cincinnati. It is an amusing idea, but the roles don't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei (Mr. Sulu on \"Star Trek). But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat. It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect \"The Great Buck Howard\" will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity, much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disappointing", "unixReviewTime": 1239753600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2009"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B001V98S2G", "reviewerName": "Dennis A. Amith (kndy)", "helpful": [20, 23], "reviewText": "In 2009, executive producer Victor Fresco (consulting producer of \"My Name is Earl\" and executive producer of \"Andy Richter Saves the Universe\") unveiled his single-camera sitcom \"Better Off Ted\" in Spring 2009 on ABC.The series revolves around a company, Veridian Dynamics which creates various products in the world (for home and for military) and focuses on the Research and Development department headed by Ted Crisp.  Each episode, we see various products/ideas being developed by the scientists.  From experiments which include freezing one of their employees, pumpkins that can be used for warfare, goo that ignites on contact with paper to bunnies used as weapons, Veridian Dynamics is a company that will develop anything that their clients ask for.  These products are implemented under the direction of Ted's emotionless boss Veronica and the research and development is overseen by Ted and then later tested courtesy of the Testing Department headed by Linda.What makes the series so entertaining is the fact that Veronica is a no-nonsense, emotionless boss who only cares about making money for the company.  Ted, although the R&D; director sides with his boss and the company but yet morally, his perspective is kept in check by his young daughter Rose.  Meanwhile, there is sexual tension between Ted and Linda, while the lab scientists provide the comic relief by developing the craziest experiments that typically has some interesting side effects.The series is shot mostly during at work inside the building of Veridian Dynamics but the hijinks that happens during each day at work is quite fun, hilarious and just outright crazy.  \"Better Off Ted\" was nominated by Entertainment Weekly's \"Ewwy Award\" for \"Best Comedy\" Series and a second season was greenlighted and will begin airing on December 2009.  And just in time before the second season premiere, \"Better Off Ted - The Complete First Season\" is now available on DVD via  2-DVD set featuring all 13 episodes.A total of 13 episodes are included on two DVD's.  Included are (note: spoiler-less summaries):DISC 1:* EPISODE 1 - PILOT - Veridian wants to freeze Phil for a year to test out a cryogenic chamber.  Meanwhile, Ted gets to know Andrea from the Testing Department.* EPISODE 2 - HEROES - Veronica asks Ted to fire Phil because of his annoying squawking (a side effect from the improper thawing of his body from the last episode).* EPISODE 3 - THROUGH ROSE COLORED HAZMAT SUITS - Ted brings his daughter Rose to his work but for some reason, his daughter is bonding with Linda.* EPISODE 4 - RACIAL SENSITIVITY - The security at Veridian Dynamics seems to not work on Black people and thus doesn't work on Lem.  Meanwhile, Linda has a boyfriend.* EPISODE 5 - WIN SOME, DOSE SOME. - Linda is exposed to an experimental energy patch that looks like a band-aid and suffers from side effects.  Meanwhile, Ted helps his daughter in a competition but Veronica tries to help out as well.* EPISODE 6 - GOODBYE MR. CHIPS - Ted accidentally erases his employee record and because of that, loses his job and must now must re-apply for his position.  Now Linda must temporarily take on the leadership role and work with the scientists.DISC 2:* EPISODE 7 - GET HAPPY - Veronica is told by her superiors to improve company morale, so she must make changes in the office, including being nice to the employees.* EPISODE 8 - YOU ARE THE BOSS OF ME - Ted wants to get closer to the scientists Lem and Phil and so he joins their Medieval Fight Club.* EPISODE 9 - BIOSHUFFLE -  Toxic ooze starts to flow in the office causing a disruption of work at Veridian Dynamics.* EPISODE 10 - TRUST AND CONSEQUENCES - Veridian Dynamics is being sued for a perfume which causes insects to attack the women wearing it.  So, each of the main members are under investigation.* EPISODE 11 - FATHER, CAN YOU HAIR ME? - The lab starts testing on a hair-growth product (which goes out of control) while Veronica hears sad news about her father (CEO of a rival company) and tries to have a father and daughter relationship.* EPISODE 12 - JABBERWOCKY - Linda believes the whole office is going eco-friendly because of a Viridian commercial of going green.* EPISODE 13 - SECRETS AND LIVES - A Veridian invention which takes an image of a person and scans the Internet of private photos reveals some images of Veronica with a magician.  Meanwhile, Linda tries to set Ted up on a date witha  friend.VIDEO & AUDIO:\"Better Off Ted - The Complete First Season\" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1).  The sitcom is filmed via single camera and has a fine layer of grain.  During the Veridian Dynamics commercials, because those commercials use stock video, you see the compression artifacts quite a bit but fortunately the commercials are short.  For the most part, the sitcom is on par with other comedy sitcoms on DVD.Audio is featured in English 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish Dolby Surround.  The series is mostly front and center channel driven.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and the music from the series sounds crystal clear.  My preference was to have my receiver on stereo on all channels.Subtitles are included in English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Better Off Ted - The Complete First Season\" box set does not contain any special features.JUDGMENT CALL:\"Better Off Ted\" is definitely a fun sitcom and personally, I like the awkwardness of the whole series.  A sitcom based on a research and development company is actually quite fascinating to me and to see how they could make a comedy series based on the experiments that go on at these companies can definitely lead to some fun and awkward storylines.Every episode for the first season has been quirky, campy and fun.  Portia de Rossi does a great job in playing Veronica, the emotionless boss at Veridian Dynamics.  Jay Harrington as Ted Crisp, the R&D; director who is caught between what the company wants and what is right, especially when his daughter is the one who gets into his moral conscience and reminding him of what is right.  Andrea Anders as Linda of the Testing Department has had her share of interesting roles in \"Joey\" and \"The Class\".  The employee who believed in Veridian Dynamics and starting to learn how the company she thought was great is actually quite immoral in some ways.  And finally the comedy relief comes from the two scientists, the emotional Phil (John Slavin) and the logical Lem (Malcolm Barrett).Part of my favorite episodes in the first season include the first two episode in which Phil is froze for scientific testing for the company, \"Father, Can You Hair Me?\" featuring Veronica trying to have a relationship with her father and hair growing from Ted's desk, \"Through Rose Colored Hazmat Suits\" featuring Ted's daughter Rose bonding with Linda which makes Ted and Linda's sexual tension much more awkward and \"Racial Sensitivity\" which was just hilarious.As for the DVD release of \"Better Off Ted - The Complete First Season\", my only disappointment with this set is the fact that there are no special features included.  You would hope there would be some featurette, some commentary, anything or something but there's nothing.But aside from that, I really enjoyed the first season of the series.  It's crazy, fun and definitely stands out from other comedy sitcoms currently on television.  Overall, \"Better Off Ted\" is a fun series, sometimes clever, sometimes campy but for the most part, definitely keeps things quite fun and enjoyable. If you enjoyed the series or even a few episodes and watch a comedy-based series, definitely give \"Better Off Ted - The Complete First Season\" a try!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Hilarious series!

Well, season 13 is better than season 12, but it is not as solid as previous SP seasons.  My favorite episodes are \"Dead Celebrities\", \"Fishsticks\", \"W.T.F.\", \"Fatbeard\", and \"Butter's Bottom B*@ch.\"  Most of the other episodes are good or have really funny moments (i.e. \"Pee\") but others are either blah (\"The Coon\" & \"The F-Word\") or have very stupid moments (i.e. \"Whale Whores\" and \"Pinewood Derby\").  The deleted scenes (on disc 1) were an excellent addition.  The deleted ending to \"Fishsticks\" is disturbing and very brutal.  Kanye West had his feelings hurt by the aired episode, how would he have felt if this ending was used? Here is a run-down of the season 13 episodes.Disc 1:1. The Ring--Kenny' new girlfriend gets all worked up when seeing the Jonas Brothers but--much to Kenny's chagrin--the band promotes purity rings.  The rings turn out to be a money-grubbing scheme concocted by a diabolical and very powerful mouse. I like how there is a girl being carried out on a stretcher at the Jonas Bros. concert.  Surprisingly, the brothers come out unscathed.2. The Coon--\"To clean the trashcan of society\" (since when does he care?) Cartman takes on the mysterious vigilante persona of \"The Coon\" for which he, of course, wants plenty of glory.  When a rival masked crime fighter arrives on the scene taking all the publicity, \"The Coon\" wants him unmasked.3. Margaritaville--South Park's banks are failing and people need an answer.  They follow the always melodramatic Randy Marsh and his teachings of an angry and vengeful economy that demands drastic cuts in spending.  Kyle takes on a role similar to a certain biblical figure to pay for all the residents' debts so they will have faith in spending again.  Meanwhile, Stan learns about the  complications and rationality (yeah, right) of the economy by encountering several annoying characters when he tries returning his dad's Margaritaville.4. Eat, Pray, Queef--The males in SP are totally grossed out when queefing in public becomes all the rage after an April Fools airing of the Queef Sisters on the Canada Channel (\"the only channel in Canada\").  Even Martha Stewart gets into the act!  The women do not understand what all the fuss is about and it turns into the battle of the sexes.  Great episode for women's empowerment.  Gross, but the scenes with Terrance and Phillip and the Queef Sisters are very funny.5. Fishsticks--The very popular episode pokes fun at Kanye West's over-inflated ego.  Jimmy--and to a lesser extent--Cartman come up with a joke that takes the nation by storm (and causes two people to vomit on the Jay Leno show).  West--self-professed genius--takes it a little too seriously.  Carlos Mencia actually gets it even worse in this episode.  Craig shows he's the most realistic of all, advising Jimmy to \"just give [Cartman] half\" of the royalties as he is not going to win a battle with the fat one.Disc 2:6. Pinewood Derby--I did not like this episode at all.  Randy wants Stan to beat Emmitt Hollis's kid at a Pinewood Derby race so badly he steals a superconducting bending magnet from Switzerland (he traveled there?) to put in the car.  The car not only wins the race, it shoots into space and contacts an alien life force.  South Park is then visited by a ridiculous stereotype gangster.  Randy on the phone with all the world leaders was also really lame.7. Fatbeard--Hearing about Somalian Pirates on the news, Cartman decides to gather a crew and make the journey to Mogadishu for adventure and pillaging using \"me mother's credit card.\"  Kyle is glad to see Cartman leave until he finds out Ike is a member of his crew.  Cartman--a natural-born leader--actually fares well with the Somalians while Ike and Butters finds out from a real Somalian Pirate that the life they are escaping is paradise to him.  Great pirate song! Cartman drops a load of F-bombs in this one.8. Dead Celebrities--My favorite from this season!  Ike sees dead celebrities--especially Billy Mays.  The dead celebs are stuck in purgatory and can't move on because one celeb cannot accept his demise.  You know who it is as soon as his voice is heard: \"No, that's ignorant...I just have a skin condition.\"  Then he morphs into Ike's body--Hilarious!  Cartman finally shows sympathy for someone other than himself:  \"Chipotlaway\" pitch-man Billy Mays.  You also get to see Kyle's parents getting it on.9. Butter's Bottom B@*ch--It's nice to see Butters--South Park's punching bag--succeed at something.  In this case, he becomes p*mp of a kissing company.  In the meantime, the chief of police keeps going a bit too far with his prostitution sting operation--Hilarious!  Butters sure cusses a lot in this episode.10. W.T.F.--After watching WWE Raw, the boys join a wrestling team but find out it's not the theatrical wrestling they expect so they form their own Wrestling Takedown Federation (WTF--ha!) which is more emphasis on soap opera than wrestling.  They become so popular that Vince MacMahon comes to see them (note: he's given a Playbill in his balcony seat).Disc 3:11. Whale Whores--This episode parodies the Whale Wars reality show with Stan joining the crew and incorporating more extreme measures but I can't get over the Enola Gay segment.  That is just stupid.12. The F Word--The boys use the F-word that rhymes with \"wag\" to refer to annoying Harley riders not for what it is commonly used for.  As the meaning of the word is changing for the younger generations, the boys try to get the head editor of Webster Dictionary, Emmanuel Lewis (get it?), to change the official meaning.  This episode is not one of the better ones, but the photos of Liberace and the biker shown to the baby made me laugh out loud.13. Dances With Smurfs\"--Cartman takes over reading the morning announcements after the previous reader was murdered on air.  He uses his new platform to criticize student body president Wendy Testaburger.  Cartman in his Glenn Beck role is hilarious.  I like when he gets the kindergarten students to recite \"socialist dung hole\" during the Pledge of Allegiance.  Also, could this be the first time in the series Eric Cartman is referred to a Eric \"Fartman\"??  Seems hard to believe that wasn't used before.14. Pee--Both Cartman and Kyle find things to be disgusted about at Pi Pi's Splashtown water park.  For Cartman it is the number of minorities at the park, for Kyle it's the number of people peeing in the pools.  The ending was a bit weak (ha! weak flow), but the song Cartman sings brought tears to my eyes.  It is probably the funniest moment of the season.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "\"Don't you get it?

Season 13 of the show manages to continue the series longer than most animated shows still without killing what the show itself is meant to be, for the most part. This season if not all out great like I feel seasons 6,8 or 11 were is at least another solid season with stand out episodes. While the show did take a few more unscheduled trips to the silly end of things they still manage to be enjoyable for true fans and it hardly feels the show is selling out or risking becoming a satire of itself. Episodes this season are:The Ring - When the Jonas brothers make Kenny's new girlfriend hot he starts wearing a promise ring like them only to become boring and a shell of his former self. [I'm in favor of anything that mocks the Jonas Brothers. I hate them so much]The Coon - During times of great Woe and Despair, \"The Coon\" rises up from the gutter to defend the city. Cartmen is the city's sole savior until Mysterion arrives on the scene and he must team with Professor Chaos to unmask the new hero. [This was an entertaining stab at more recent super hero movies Dark Knight and Watchmen. If nothing else we get to see Professor Chaos again and the scenes with the stupid cops are great. I'm also surprised how few people were upset by the subtle allusion to Obama in this episode and it's controversial title]Margaritaville - While the town fights over who to blame for the poor economy, Randy steps forward with a plan to live without an economy at all. Soon the town returns to biblical times and only a Jew willing to pay for our sins can save us. Meanwhile in trying to return his father's unneeded margarita maker, Stan symbolically explores the actual problem with the economy. [A great episode with a classic South Park premise, Emmy Winner]Eat, Pray, Queef - An April Fool's Day joke gone wrong finds America's women and two Canadian women much like Terrence and Phillip standing up for their right to 'fart' like men do, despite how truly disgusting the men find it. [Definitely not one of the best episodes but definitely a fun joke at the root of it and it perfectly reflects part of the male mind. Would have been better with less Terrence and Phillip, though it was nice to see them again and the recurring references to Matt & Trey's April Fool's Day joke gone wrong in '98 are always ammusing self relevance]Fishsticks - When Jimmy comes up with a great new joke about fishsticks Cartmen tries to take credit and then so does comedian Carlos Mencia. Meanwhile Kanye West doesn't get the joke and winds up becoming the joke himself. [A great episode considering it's centered on such a simple joke and manages to attack so many people so well. Do you like fishsticks? Then you must be a gay fish.]Pinewood Derby - When Randy lies to help Stan win the Pinewood Derby it results in him teaching his son how to cover up a lie only for things to obviously escalate to ridiculous levels. [A fun episode that takes a good shot at recent politics and the absurd lengths people will go to try and cover up something that's already obvious to the rest of us.]Fatbeard - Cartmen decides to become a pirate and drags Butters and a rag tag crew along only to wind up being unknowingly kidnapped by real Somalian Pirates. While Cartmen lives the life of a fairy tale pirate, the US tries to get them out of the hostage situation.[Finally another episode hitting directly on what was happening in the news that week. Very funny visuals and it wonderfully comments on the events. If not a truly great episode, it's good.]Dead Celebrities - When Ike is being haunted by the presence of dead celebrities the boys call in the ghost hunters only to realize they only scare themselves by bumping into things in the dark. Soon the boys learn the numerous recent dead celebrities wont't move on because one refuses to accept his death and possesses Ike, leading to a hilarious scene that mocks the perversion of toddler beauty pagents. [This episode made me think there could be a new era of South Park episodes. Amazing in it's execution, mocking several things well and again based right on the headlines with deeper meanings to be found in the humor. Genius.]Butter's Bottom Bitch - Butters first kiss from a girl finds him realizing why boys would pay for kisses. When he tries to start a kissing ring it escalates, unbeknownst to him, to a prostitution ring. Soon a dedicated cop is trying to take down Butters who has transformed into a P.I.M.P. [A funny topic I'm surprised they haven't commented on more before. Player's Ball scenes were great and an enjoyable episode with lots of laughs]W.T.F. - After going to a wrestling event the boys all want to become wrestlers. When they learn what real wrestling is on the school team they opt out to form their own wrestling arena where their over the top acting is so good Vince MCMahon stops by to possibly recruit them. [Amazing in how it completely properly comments on what Wrestling has become and ties in the \"Took our job\" guys taking there bit to a new extreme and gives us the new hilarious character of the school wrestling teacher who everyone thinks is gay. A personal favorite.]Whale Whores - When Stan's birthday trip to the Aquarium is ruined by Japanese Dolphin killer's he sets out to stop them and make a difference in the world. He crosses paths with several Discovery Channel reality shows before realizing they don't actually do anything. In the end we see why the Japanese hate Dolphins and Whales so much. [Excellent beginning in how it mocks several things. It looses some steam but the final joke is amusing and the episode as a whole is fun. Especially the turnaround on the Japanese being thought cruel for slaughtering dolphins and whales but America will accept them slaughtering cows because that's normal]The F Word - When the boys use the f word (ends in an ag) to describe some attention seeking Harley rider's everyone gets upset. The Harley rider's explore the origin of the word while the boys fight to explain their meaning of the word versus the meaning the adults have. [Some didn't like this episode. I have argued the point it makes for years. The definition of words is always changing and I agree that the F word now means the definition given at the end of this episode, or at least loud annoying people who crave attention]Dances With Smurfs - When Cartmen takes over the announcements at school he becomes like many recent supposed journalists who just use free speech as an excuse to package their opinion as fact. Soon he is targeting class president Wendy and accusing her of elaborately made up lies.[A fun episode that takes good shots at Avatar, the recent so called journalists and the very recent headlines of a politician who actually claimed to have run off to the mountains]Pee - When the boys go to a water park Kyle is bothered by the discovery that everyone, including Stan, pees in the pools. Cartmen is disillusioned by the abundance of minorities. Then when the pool PH levels are nearly all P and no H disaster strikes leaving Kyle to face his fear of urine and Cartmen believing he is the last white man alive. [If not a great season finale it does mock the stupidity of 2012, has a good running bit for Kyle and has the hilarious story of Cartmen believing he has become the world's last majority surrounded by minorities and singing an awesome song about it while making a true statement about America]This season set (Available in 3 disc DVD or 2 disc Blu-Ray) contains the same mini commentaries included on each season set since the third season. Nowadays Matt and Trey have caught up with themselves and are commenting on episodes right after (and in some cases before) they've finished making them. I personally found this set's mini-com's to be very entertaining and funny. This is also the first season to contain deleted scenes, which unlike most shows, are actually entertaining stuff that just had to be cut for time. Another interesting special feaure for true South Park fans is an XBOX Live segment giving fans a look inside South Park studios.Also included is some sort of X-Box cross promotion for a game called, South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! XLBA, that will give purchasers of this DVD or Blu-Ray a free character and two unlockable levels, whatever that means.All in all I continue to commend South Park for avoiding satirizing itself like other favorites the Simpsons, or even Family Guy. This show is always just about pointing out how stupid things are and as long as they never take that too serial then they will always have good episodes if not great ones. It's hard to expect them to come up with constant simplistically genius episode concepts like Guitar Queer-o, Make Love Not Warcraft, Good Times With Weapons or Imaginationland on a nonstop basis. So a mere good season is forgiven as long as it contains great episodes which this one does. Five Stars for being as Funny and certainly as Entertaining as Ever.*After having now rewatched the episodes, this season stands up much better in second viewing.

I thought Clemmy was hilarious as well as Garcia with his red hot temper (plus I think he's hot).  I even liked Kimball, especially with her religious fundamentalism and the possible romance with cousin Travis Junior.  Well, I was surprised how well I liked the new characters: Sgt. Jack Declan the tough, angry fat guy (although he has, according to the commentaries, since lost a lot of weight) and the exuberant New Yorker Dep. Frank Rizzo who is also really cute.  They fit into the department right from the first episode.  I also like the quasi romantic connection between Wiegel and Rizzo.  I've just heard from the cyberspace grapevine that this is the last season so, unfortunately, that storyline won't be further developed.  Reoccurring sketches include the Mexican radio station, high school metal detector, the white trash gal Carmen, senior abuse public service announcements, the mental hospital, the lonely ranger, the library, classroom presentations, the sexy car wash, the guy with the boat (I don't care for those skits), Cindy the ex-sex slave turned dispatcher, and Terry the roller skater.  Other sketches are listed below along with what I consider highlights.Disc 1:1. Dangle mentions in passing a couple times that two deputies were blown up last season (what about the third?).  Trudy introduces the \"Suicide Prevention Webpage.\"  Frank Rizzo gives some background on his well-traveled law enforcement career.  Rizzo becomes Jones's partner and schools him on how to complete a drug bust.  Williams and Dangle escort an employee from his workplace.  Sgt. Declan visits his informant Terry.  Highlight:  the KKK winery.2. Doll trouble.  Air Overnight delivers \"presents\" from \"Joe Public.\"  Williams and Wiegel give makeovers at the high school metal detector.  Dangle and Rizzo conduct surgery.  Highlight:  Patton Oswalt guest stars as a man confessing to a crime for a trip to Tailand which leads to a hilarious airplane scene.  The commentary talks about the special effects and how much that doll costs.3. The department holds their meetings at Capt. Crabby's Crab Shack because of the asbestos at the station (why would they be eating seafood so early in the morning?).  A convicted murderer leads Dangle and Williams to a buried victim.  The dept. keeps a blind man in the restaurant and pretend its a jail by yelling lines like a 1930s African American family.  Highlight:  Wiegel and Rizzo commandeer a tour bus.  Rizzo tells the group he once had a 300 game at a bowling alley they passed.  The commentary has Thomas Lennon and Niecy Nash talking about Raineesha's booty.4. One of my favorite episodes.  Dangle hosts a murder mystery dinner.  Among the guests are Dangle's ex-wife, her other ex-husband and current fiancee (played by \"Kids in the Hall\" comedian Scott Thompson).  She obviously likes guys a little on the peculiar side. Williams plays a mammy and Trudy is supposed to be the victim--things do not work out that way, however.5. Conclusion of the murder mystery where all sorts of gossip comes out about the guests.  Highlight:  Terry is accused of trying on fruit at the produce section of the Piggly Wiggly.6.  A team from the Vatican comes to Reno to determine if the city is worthy of a visit by the pope and the department does whatever it can to discourage the visit.7.  Old videos showing the department back in the day is shown.  Highlight:  Trudy sings a song about blocking bad words on the library search engine (brought tears to my eyes), Jones running out of a meth lab screaming when he is shot at.Disc 2:8. Rizzo harasses a soccer coach to get his kid more playing time.  Junior and Dangle help Mayor Hernandez with a scandal involving a hooker and a drive through. Commentary by Ian Roberts and Joe Lo Truglio.9.  Rizzo and Wiegel are trapped in a moving motor home and love is in the air.  Highlights:  Mario the cute little witness protection dog.  Trudy talking at the end of the episode about what went on in the trailer.  That brought tears to my eyes.  Commentary by Joe Lo Truglio and Kerry Kenny-Silver.10. Dangle's 10-year tribute to the death of Princess Diana is ready for showtime, much to the chagrin of the department.  Wiegel's video will is shown.  Highlight:  Jesus Christ Superstar party.11. The department hires Levon French of the popular Linoleum City commercials to film a recruitment video.  The commentary reveals a real life run-in with the Sparks police.12. Sgt. Declan passes his anger management course, though you wouldn't know it.  Williams and Wiegel try to clean up gang graffiti and get shot at. Junior and Declan are after unlicensed merchandise of Nickelodeon characters.  Rizzo helps a family whose brakes have failed.  Commentary: Robert Ben Garant and Ian Roberts talk about eating scenes and other things.13.  The department fires the ashes of Garcia out of a cannon.  Jones and Wiegel try to bust a swinger party--Jones's outfit is outrageous.  Commentary:  Cedric Yarbrough and Niecy Nash talk about Cedric losing weight and other things, including what Raineesha should do to Junior next season--so they must have thought there would be a season 7.14. Three strangers wind up in the department and the crew tries to figure out who they are.  Secret Santa is debated.15. Wiegel gets Williams to pretend they are a couple so she can use more of her psychotherapy benefits.  Dangle pulls out his gun at Burger Cousin.

The series created by Ryan Murphy (writer for \"Nip/Tuck\", \"Popular\"), Brad Falchuk (producer for \"Nip/Tuck\") and Ian Brennan would gain attention because of its music but for the most part, it would prove to become successful with its catchy music (with actual talent that can sing), a witty storyline and its well-cast characters.The series proved to become so popular that two soundtracks have been released for the television series and even was nominated for four 2010 Golden Globe Awards.  With support from various media sites to even celebrities and a fanbase that have branded themselves as \"gleeks\". \"Glee\", although not exactly original (\"Fame\" was known for its musical teens in the 1980's and the teenage jock musical was featured heavily in the Disney \"High School Musical\" films) and a cast of talent playing teenagers from various ethnicities and even one who is handicapped, \"Glee\" manages to capture the drama of high school life but also the fun of watching this group of underdogs trying to succeed.\"glee - The Complete First Season\" features the following 22 episodes on seven DVD's.VIDEO:\"glee - The Complete First Season\" is presented in widescreen 1:78:1.  Shot digitally, this is a series that I'm sure would look fantastic on the Blu-ray release.  As for the DVD release, picture quality is cool as some parts showcase the vibrant colors of the series but one thing I noticed is that the pilot episode definitely shows a lot of noise but as the series progressed towards the second half of the first seaosn, picture quality was much better.  Blacks are nice and deep and skin tones look natural on the DVD but for the most part, picture quality for \"glee\" very good on DVD.  But for those who are concerned with picture quality will definitely want to \"glee - The Complete First Season\" on Blu-ray.  Otherwise, the DVD is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"glee - The Complete First Season\" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby  Digital Surround.  The series is front and center channel driven but with those who own modern home-theater receivers may find it a benefit to have the audio set at stereo on all channels if they have a 5.1, 7.2 or higher setup.  Audio is clear and understandable but what matters for a series such as \"glee\" is how the music sounds and for the most part, music sounds great.  There is crowd ambiance in the school hallways or chatter in during the competitions but for the most part, \"glee\" is a front and center channel-driven soundtrack.  And similar to the video, if you are an audiophile, then you will definitely want the lossless soundtrack and go with the Blu-ray version.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"glee - The Complete First Season\" comes with the following special features:DISC 4:* Welcome to McKinley! - (5:02) A video of Principal Figgins introducing 8th graders to his office before they go to McKinley High School.

It's really interesting to see how the group dynamics start to evolve from the beginning to the 13th episode and by the second half, you can tell that the hiatus leading to the second half of the series and the popularity of the series definitely made the series get a boost in the types of music that can be utilized, better production value and the cast seem to gel much more.And it's no surprise as 2009-2010 have been incredible for the cast members and crew.  From award nominations, the cast receiving love from a lot of television show critics and soundtracks that continue to sell incredibly well.  \"glee\" also features solid writing that goes hand-in-hand with the awesome musical performances and for the most part, \"glee - The Complete First Season\" is a fantastic DVD set.But what hooked me to the series was the music.  Personally, I'm not a fan of covers but the fact that the people on the show can sing and for the most part, how the songs are incorporate to the storyline has definitely made me a weekly viewer of the series.  Also, the talent can sing...Matthew Morrison, Leah Michele and Amber Riley do a great job but also for the writers to recognize that its not good that only a few characters receive the spotlight and diversifying the various musical performances to other characters as well, so they can showoff their vocals.Also, it's important to note that these characters are not perfect teens and not everyone bursts into song ala \"High School Musical\".  \"Glee\" is not a group of perfect teenagers, each of these characters have their faults but these characters are well fleshed out in the series that you actually care about these characters and each play their part in each episode.  Will, a teacher and the director of the Glee Club deals with his marital strife with his wife, who is determined to make sure her husband doesn't leave him.  Quinn must deal with being a single mother, Mercedes deals with her weight, Artie deals with being in a wheel chair, Curt deals with how people look at him because he is homosexual and each characters has their own set of issues.  It's high school life and it's great to see the students have their own set of issues, as well as the adults.While the first season had a pretty interesting storyline with Will trying to get the glee club going and dealing with his wife, the second half of the series is where things get even more interesting in drama dynamics.  Throw in Jesse St. James of Vocal Adrenaline, throw in Curt falling for Finn, Quinn having to deal with her pregnancy and finding friendship from a person she never expected to get close to, seeing things develop between Will and Emma and more.  And of course, Sue Sylvester was absolutely wonderful this season.  And as for the music, especially with the Madonna and Lady Gaga episodes, the music for the whole season was fantastic.There is no doubt that \"glee\" is a series that now has a great budget to license these songs for television, CD and also for the DVD release and just by seeing the sheer amount of songs used on each episode, I'm sure that the music takes a big chomp out of the budget.  But that is what makes \"glee\" work and that is the ability to use contemporary music (and classics) to attract listeners of young and old.Also, by the second season, it looks as if the talent are more at ease and comfortable working with each other.  The vocals are of the cast are much better, the chemistry between the characters are also well done (the interaction between Will and Sue is fantastic) and there is better use of the characters that like Santana and Brittany and also getting some of the other background characters involved as well.For those who purchased \"glee Season 1 Volume 1' and intend to purchase \"glee - The Complete First Season\".  You can also get a $10 rebate by sending the proof of purchase that comes with this DVD set and also providing a mail-in form and a barcode from the first DVD release.Overall, there are a good amount of special features on this DVD box set to keep Gleeks busy but for those who wonder what the hub-bub is all about and why the media is giving so much coverage to this series, check this DVD out and you'll see what is so special about \"glee\".  It's a series that is fun to watch, cool characters, solid performances and a series that has a fantastic soundtrack.  \"glee - The Complete First Season\" is highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "DVD: \"glee - The Complete First Season\" is highly recommended!", "unixReviewTime": 1285200000, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2010"}, {"reviewerID": "A3T0OTH5072YRE", "asin": "B002962RKE", "reviewerName": "M. Reynard \"kairosdreaming\"", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewText": "Ok, so I have to admit, when I saw the advertisements for this show, all I could think of was that it looked cheesy and very tween centered.  Then I saw an episode on TV, intrigued I took a look at Hulu and caught some of the second season episodes they had there.  Now, its a guilty pleasure and I just had to get the first season to see how it all started.Glee is a great show in that its positive.  Sure there's some mature themes in it, but really, its about life and that just makes it more realistic.  It shows overcoming obstacles and reaching for your dreams.  But most importantly, it has great music.  Glee is about the New Directions, a glee club who isn't very popular at school but enjoys each other's company and can put on quite the show.  They have several struggles and triumphs through the series and in order to stay as a club at the school, have the ultimate goal of placing in regionals to keep their funding.Characters:Artie Abrams (Kevin Mchale) is a paraplegic and a guitar player.  He has dreams of being a dancer and also is a love interest for Tina.Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) is annoying yet determined.  She wants to be a star and will let nothing stand in her way.  She grows through the series and has to learn that it isn't all about her, despite her talent.Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) is a goth wonderful singer with a stutter.  She spends most of her time with Mercedes and Artie and learns to accept herself for who she is and not drive people away.Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is head cheerleader and cruelly vicious.  After spying for Sue Sylvester on the glee club and then ending up pregnant, she instead finds solace and friendship in the group.Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is a little unintelligent but has a lot of heart.  Quarterback of the football team he is blackmailed into joining the glee club because of his outstanding voice, but later learns that its where he wants to be.Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is an out of the closet gay student.  He has a wonderful singing voice, and is a bit diva-ish but really appreciates his friends.  He is often bullied for his unique nature.Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) is a main diva.  She isn't afraid to express who she is and competes with Rachel for solos in the club.  She is a Cheerio at one point, but returns to Glee because its where her heart is.Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) is another of Sue's spies but admits that Glee is the best part of her day.  She gives the other members a hard time and is sometimes vicious.Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is another of Sue's spies but cannot perform the task adequately as she is a complete airhead.  She's a great dancer and often unintentionally provides comic relief for the group.Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is the school's guidance counselor.  She has extreme OCD and during most of the season has a crush on Will that in some parts is returned.  She is also engaged to the coach Ken Tanaka during the series.Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) is the bad boy of the group.  Known for his trademark mohawk and being great with the ladies, he joins the glee club after being in the Acafellas with Will.  He is a love interest for several of the group's girls.Will Schuester (Mark Morrison) is the glee club director and Spanish teacher.  He has a good heart but doesn't always listen to the kid's on what they want.  But he learns quickly and always tries to do his best for them.  A former Glee club member himself, he is a great singer and dancer.  He has a lot of love interests and has trouble with relationships.Terry Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) is Will's neurotic wife.  Originally seen as controlling and bossy, she mellows out when trying to hide a secret from Will.  She cannot overcome her jealousy and suspicion however and does not add to the relationship very much.Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is definitely the nemesis of the Glee Club.  Head of the vastly awarded Cheerio's she is upset that Will's club is cutting into her budget.  She'll stop at nothing to destroy the New Directions.  She does have moments where her inner goodness shines out however, and it keeps the audience guessing.Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr) is a football player who is also a great dancer.  He plays a minor role in the series but is great at backup.Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) is Kurt's father.  He's a bit confused about how to do right for his gay son, but ultimately loves him and wants the best for him.Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) is the head of the school paper and has an extreme crush on Rachel.  She is often seen trying to avoid him.Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) is a member of the Cheerio's that has Down Syndrome.  She becomes Sue's special sidekick.Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is a football member that has joined glee club.  He plays a very minor part often doing backup.Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) is a nice guy but easily mislead.  He cowtows to Sue and often doesn't rule favorably for the glee club.  He tries to do what is right however and does save them once in awhile.Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) is the former glee club director.  He was removed for inappropriate conduct and is later used for comic relief and the selling of illegal drugs.Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) is the coach of the school teams.  He is in love with Emma and jealous of Will.  He causes problems at times but ultimately is just a guy who wants to be loved.Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) is the coal of the rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline.  She is also Rachel's biological mother.Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) is the lead singer of Vocal Adrenaline.  For a time he is a love interest of Rachel's before becoming a rival again.April Rhodes (Kristin Chenowenth) is a washed up former glee club member who never finished high school.  After a stroke of good luck and some help from Will she ends up rich and helps out the glee club.There are many other characters, but most play minor roles.As a whole I think they did a great job of casting the characters.  They also included some cameos such as Josh Groban and Olivia Newton John and also Neil Patrick Harris.  There were some characters that I just didn't care for however.  I'm not a big fan of the Emma Pillsbury character.  I realize she's a love interest for Will but I think her arc in the story takes a lot away from the show's true purpose; the glee club.  She also, despite her eccentricities, just isn't that interesting and I can't see why Will would be interested in her.  The same would go for her boyfriend in the series, Ken Tanaka.  He makes things hard for Will and the football players, but aside from that, doesn't add too much.Most of the characters I love though.  Artie is fantastic and you really feel compassion for him especially in the episode on dancing.  Sue Sylvester is great.  She plays the perfect villain and I can never tell what she's going to do next.  All of the Glee club members really know how to put on a show.Episodes:The First Season has 22 episodes and they are all jam-packed with music, dancing, and your soap opera-ish type plot lines that seem to be popular.**Warning, some of these episode descriptions could be considered spoilers for plot lines.Pilot:This introduces us to the gang and also to the formidable Will Scheuster, a Spanish teacher, former glee club member, and the new director of the Glee club.  The group largely consists of outcasts and starts only five members strong.  But they've got talent, it just needs to be explored.  We are also introduced to Will's formidable wife Terry and the guidance counselor who has a crush on him, Emma Pillsbury.Shomance:In order to try to get some new members (and not be slushied in the face) the group puts together a number to sing in front of the whole school.  Will takes on some new responsibility since he has learned Terri is pregnant, but she isn't telling him the whole truth. Glee Club's Arch Nemesis Sue Sylvester (coach of the award winning Cheerio's cheer squad) sends some cheerleaders as spies into the glee club.Acafellas:Will forms an all male vocal group and in doing so gives up some responsibility to the glee club.  They hire a dance instructor, but realize that they just need to accept each other for who they are.  Especially Kurt as he struggles with his sexuality.Preggers:In this episode, Kurt comes out of the closet, but also joins the football team. Quinn tells Finn that he is the father of her baby and they have to decide what they are going to do with their future despite the fact that she knows Puck is actually the father.  The Glee club also helps the football team win a game.The Rhodes Not Taken:With Rachel quitting to perform in the school play, Will enlists former glee member April Rhodes to be in the glee club.  As she never graduated high school, she is still able to do this.  While struggling to overcome April's bad influence on the group and competing at sectionals, the glee clubbers have a lot on their plate.Vitamin D:After their success at Invitationals, the team feels too confident to perform adequately so Will has the girls compete against the boys.  However, Terri, newly appointed as the school nurse gives the kids over the counter drugs to help them pep up and ultimately gets them in even more trouble.Throwdown:With Sue as co-director of the Glee club, things couldn't be more tense.  She tries to pit the group against each other and then the group becomes even more disheveled when its revealed to the rest of the school that Quinn is pregnant.Mash-Up:When asked to come up with a way to mash two very unlikely song together for Emma and Ken's wedding, Will has to struggle with his feelings for Emma.  These aren't the only relationship problems in this episode as Finn, Quinn, Rachel, and Puck all have to deal with their feelings as well.Wheels:When its revealed how hurt Artie is that he can't travel with the rest of the group they try to raise money to rent a wheelchair accessible school bus for him to take to regionals.  Artie learns something unexpected about Tina, and Sue shows her softer side.Ballad:Will assigns the group a task to sing ballads to each other about how they feel.  This results in a lot of secrets being exposed and Finn telling Quinn's parents about her pregnancy.Hairography:When they see their competition for regionals (and Will is subsequently impressed by their use of hair in dance) they all don the wings and have a rockin time using \"Hairography\" in their routines.  Quinn considers putting the baby up for adoption.Mattress:After a big uproar about the team not appearing in the yearbook Rachel finds a way to try to make them popular again by starring in a local Mattress company commercial.  This compromises them however, as they are paid in mattresses and this could disqualify them from competition.  Will discovers Terri has been lying to him about her pregnancy and spends the night at the school.Sectionals:With Will stepping down from coaching the club, Emma postpones her wedding to take the team to sectionals where they learn that their set-list as been leaked to the opposing teams.  With not a lot of hope in sight, and Finn not showing up as he learns the truth about Quinn's baby, they have to find a way to win in spite of the troubles.Hell-O:This ones all about relationships.  Will and Emma struggle to accept each other the way they are.  Finn is undecided about Rachel and Sue has Santana and Brittany try to ruin that relationship.  Rachel also meets the lead singer of a rival glee club and makes a connection.The Power of Madonna:Just like it sounds, this episode pays homage to Madonna.  With the girls feeling inferior, Will assigns them Madonna songs hoping it will make them feel empowered.Home:When Finn finds out that his mother and Kurt's father are dating he's not sure how to take it. April comes back and helps the team with their auditorium problems and Mercedes learns to feel good about herself.Bad Reputation:After a list ranking the glee club members by hotness circulates, they try to figure out ways to make themselves \"badder\" in order to rise on the list.  This results in relationships being broken, feelings being hurt, and quite a bit of slushie facials.Laryngitis:When Rachel loses her voice she thinks its the end of the world.  Kurt struggles with his identity and begins dating Brittany.Dream On:When Will's old rival in glee club Bryan Ryan wants to cut Glee from the school budget, he has to give up some of his dreams in order to keep it going.  Artie also has to come to term with his dreams of being a dancer.Theatricality:This episode pays homage to Lady Gaga and all her craziness.  Rachel meets her mother and Kurt and Finn's families move in together creating tension.Funk:After feeling a bit defeated by Vocal Adrenaline, a competing team, Will teaches the glee club that they have funk and soul.  Rachel is also devastated when Jesse returns to Vocal Adrenaline.Journey:The team's performance at Regionals will determine their future in the school.  However, they've just learned that Sue is one of the judges and are feeling depressed.  Quinn goes into labor.As a whole the episodes are great and I enjoy the music.  I should note however that some of the plot lines tend to get stale and drawn out.  They also focus more on some characters than others and while the tension between Rachel and Finn is interesting, it just gets boring after awhile.  Some of the more minor characters have great back stories and I'd love to see it expanded.Some of the story lines were quite touching though.  Quite a few timse there were moments in the show that I could feel tears coming to my eyes.  Now that's good writing!Music:Since this is Glee I have to talk about the music.  The show uses a mix of modern tunes and old classics and of course show tunes.  They use Madonna, Lady Gaga, Journey, and other popular artists in their works.  The actors do their own singing but it is slightly noticeable that it is prerecorded.I did enjoy most of the music but thought they got a little heavy handed with the show tunes and broadway hits once in awhile.  Its not that they're not good songs, I just thought the performances and singing for the modern hits were much better done and also better coreographed.~~~This is a great family friendly tv series.  While it explores some mature themes (teen pregnancy, virginity, drugs, etc.) it does so in an approachable way and a parent can easily sit and explain right choices to their kids while watching.  But its also entertaining for adults.  There are plot lines that keep it interesting and music to keep you entertained.  While I would love to see more music there's only so much they can fit into an hour long episode.  Fantastic series and I highly recommend watching it.Review by M.

Amith (kndy)", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "For over a decade, \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" has become such a tremendous hit for Nickelodeon and an animated series that many children have grown up with. A popular franchise which includes video games, the character featured on a variety of food products, toys, health-related items and more.Needless to say, \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", although not a series shown on broadcast television, has managed to become a character that is part of American pop culture and still shows no signs of waning, especially with a new group of young viewers every year.With the release of \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Season 6, Volume 1' last December, many have been patiently waiting for the second volume to be released and now it's here, just in time for the holidays.Instead of breaking the seasons in half with two volumes, this time around, Nickelodeon has given us a complete season set with \"SpongeBob SquarePants:Complete Seventh Season\" features 50 mini-episodes (9 hours) which aired on Nickelodeon from July 2009 through June 2011.

Typically, Nickelodeon has split the season sets in half but this time around, it's nice to know all episodes from season seven are on this four-DVD set release.Since the debut of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" back in 1999, the series hasn't let up in terms of storytelling and continues to raise the bar for wacky, embarrassing and even moronic moments for SpongeBob, Patrick and friends.My home is \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" mania for my eight-year-old. For the past three years, he has been a big fan of the animated series and has wanted everything that the character is featured on, may it be yogurt to toothpaste, he is a SpongeBob maniac and thus, he was excited when I watched this DVD alongside with him. I can't help but think that if my son is this way, I can imagine how in the last decade, parents had to deal with their children loving this animated series and wanting SpongeBob this and SpongeBob that.  My wife and I have found the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" to be a hilarious and fun series. Especially when interacting with your kids, especially with the family singing along with the theme song.With that being said, there are some mannerisms that children may repeat and may not be as pleasant.  So, if your kids pick up some words such as \"moron\" or things that Squidward uses to refer to SpongeBob and Patrick, that is where parents will probably want to step in.And as many wonder if a season that has gone so long with many episodes can hit a wall of mundane storylines, so far the writers have been good in creating hilarious, fun and crazy episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants from beginning to the present with this seventh season.  From SpongeBob becoming a model, Mrs. Puff working during the summer at the Krusty Krab, Plankton trying to do all he can to steal the recipe for the Krabby Patty and many, many more crazy episodes.As for the DVD itself, it's a pretty solid DVD featuring plenty of episodes and these newer episodes definitely look better in quality compared to its older season counterpars. Animation is cleaner and more vibrant. For those who own the previous DVD releases of \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom\", \"SpongeBob Square Pants: The Great Patty Caper\" and \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Heroes of Bikini Bottom\" will get a rehash of the same episodes featured on this DVD box set from those DVD releases but still, where most DVD releases come with six mini-episodes, \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Complete Seventh Season\" comes with 50 mini-episodes and you also get a good number of animated short special features included as well.If you are a parent or grandparent, with the holidays coming up and are looking for animated DVD's for the children (with many episodes) to keep them busy at home or during long commutes, \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Complete Seventh Season\" will no doubt keep them entertained. And if there is one thing I have learned with my child and also nephews, no matter how many times they have watched these episodes, they don't get bored by it.Overall, these new episodes are safe and parents don't need to worry about anything negative. Although, there are some words some children may pickup from the series but for the most part, these episodes are safe for children and for seven seasons now, the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" series has been entertaining many children all world.And the fact that you get a full season's worth of episodes instead of a season broken in half is a big deal for many fans and I hope it stays that way!If your a parent or grandparent of children who love \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" or just a young fan at heart, \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Complete Seventh Season\" is definitely worth picking up!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Featuring all 50-mini episodes from the season 7 (2009-2011) from \"SpongeBob Square Pants\"", "unixReviewTime": 1335571200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A39SJ6V6QCGC37", "asin": "B002JPC4P8", "reviewerName": "Midge", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "A prime example of how an excellent idea, exceptional design, award winning props and a promising storyline with a compelling cast can be utterly destroyed by poor directorial & storyline delivery, slow pacing & bad direction (no doubt prompted by misguided producers) while barraging the audience with endless flashbacks in every episode.There is such a thing as too much realism. We all know how slowly things occur in real space but it does not translate to a television audience. The pace should have been quickened quite a bit. The dragging on & on of every scene was painful to watch on DVD. I can only imagine how slowly it dragged in weekly episodes with commercials. They spent 3/4 of an entire episode just reeling in the tether of a stranded astronaut. Also the suit limitations on the last episode were preposterous to make such an ordeal for such a short distance. We have better technology in our homes. How about an all metal tractor vehicle or remote fetch device. Yes, even in that heat & pressure. That was downright aggravating just on stupidity for lack of tech device capabilities. It should be about using innovations to overcome defeat. Not the failings of technology. Just because NASA cant get things right doesn't mean our TV series have to follow suit. NASA & DOD have Compartmentalization & isolation creating stupid mistakes & dampening creativity. Our TV series can do better by sharing ideas & inventing impressive solutions & new hi-tech ideas to thrill the audience. Not make them groan with defeat. The TV Show should lead the way. Not follow failures.There is also a limit to flashbacks. This show exceeded the tolerance after the first two episodes & actually confused the audience when they couldn't tell which timeframe they were watching. But they continued these flashback fillers on every painful episode to the very last scene. A Sci fi show needs a quicker pacing crammed with the best & latest technology perceivable. It does not need a weekly disaster. Any soap opera can keep an audience interested 5 days a week for decades. If they can find material, there is no excuse for lack of innovation for a weekly scifi. Finally, any of the 4 main networks are death to a Scifi series. Take it to syfy or UPI or Ion or Tru TV or TLC. Anyplace but the 4 old fogy networks. Remember? The ones who killed Star Trek? Do you really think they learned their lessons? We still hold a grudge against the big 3 for their rigid mindset nearly 50 years later. Why would you waste any decent show idea on blockheads like that? They don't deserve nor have the intelligence to recognize a good program when they see it. The 4 networks only still exist as a source of local news & for the few people who can't have satellite or cable broadcast channels.Another major fopah is Nadia, the inappropriate female sexual harasser. This may have been ok in the 70's but no one has tolerance for sexual harassment especially in the workplace. It is against the law & is heavily lectured against by all corporations. There is zero tolerance for this behavior by either gender. It isn't cute nor appreciated by the audience. She would have been fired & in jail for her behavior. The audience has zero tolerance of this behavior. I don't know what dinosaur created her, but they have no business involved in creating a TV series.Revamp the show. Quicken the pace, fire the writers & directors. Hire the techno-geeks from Eureka & some of their writers & directors. Combine the two show concepts. Create some science experiments & inventions gone wild. More personal issues & interactions without creating an orgy. More space encounters: meteors, UFO's paralleling & checking them out; dogfights with ET (there should be more than one type of ET besides the singing Beta which the other ETs are interested in without creating some alien battle show. Just a moderate, gentle-mix like our real ISS has to deal with. They Appear with curiosity but don't directly interact.There are also maintenance & other tasks to be written into the story. But no weekly disaster. Just repairs, technology & personal interaction with stress. The Donner Zoe love story should be encouraged. The pace must be a lot faster. No vague mysteries dragging along week after week. These Beta etc. must do something much more meaningful & impressive each week & communicate without this constant Negative guilt Complex. Get rid of these guilt themes. Stop dragging down the audience. Be uplifting. hopeful. Technological. Get away from that theological theme. It must be immensely positive & special powers from it for the crew. Perhaps genetic improvements like spontaneous healing or telepathy. Perhaps a miracle star child for Donner & Zoe by regenerating their reproductive systems & raising their child on the journey. No more guilt sequences for either the space crew or ground crew. That negative element must cease.Revamp the show & take it to the other cable networks. It is still salvageable with a faster pace, much more tech & extremely limited flashbacks.You will also need an award winning theme song which captures the attention of anyone who hears it. It must be a catchy, recognizable tune which you will find on nearly all top TV Series. This current theme sounds like a cat randomly walking over a keyboard. This is not a top series theme song. This is not a theme song at all. It is irritating noise.If you make these changes & improvements you can still sell this show to another cable network & make it work. But you must be prepared to show them you are quickening the pace, dumping the flashbacks & female sex addict, while beefing up the technology & redirecting this into a tech solutions team, with a super science geek, aspiring love story, exciting space occurrences & discoveries with a dynamic, memorable theme song.That is how you can make a second go at selling this idea.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "SALVAGEABLE despite slow pace & flashbacks", "unixReviewTime": 1358812800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M", "asin": "B002KGB2EU", "reviewerName": "e. verrillo", "helpful": [12, 17], "reviewText": "Season One of Lie to Me was promising. The premise was interesting, the plots engaging and Tim Roth is a wonderful actor. However, by Season Two, the flaws that are inherent in a show about someone who ALWAYS knows when people are lying started to wreak havoc. (Hey, why bother with a judicial system? Just have Lightman ask, \"Did you do it?\")The main problem with Lie to Me is that Cal Lightman is the only character who is interesting.  I mean, what do the rest of them actually DO? There are twenty or so people running around a fancy office suite that is called the \"Lightman Group\" but where's the group? They've got an intern, Eli Loker, whose job it is to look scruffy.  Although, later he gets promoted to \"vice-president\" after a year of being an UNPAID intern.  (I should only be so lucky.  And who's president anyway?  Who's on first?) Torres is obviously window dressing.  (She doesn't even have any training in psychology--let alone acting.) And Lightman's partner, Foster, is there to say \"I feel your pain\" and stumble around on 6-inch stilettos. (To be fair, all the women in the show wear 6-inch stilettos. And don't get me started on the collagenized lips.) And because Lightman is the only person with brains, the writers had to invent juvenile stuff for the other characters to do (i.e. almost kissing, nearly kissing, finally kissing) which didn't require any. Bo-ring.The other glaring problem is that by the second half of Season Two, it becomes manifestly clear that the writers have no idea what they are doing. First, Lightman has to pay off his ex-wife in order to keep her from taking their daughter to another state. (That NEVER happens in real life. With joint custody, neither parent can move the child out of state. Didn't these people watch Boston Legal?) Having paid off his wife, his business is about to collapse. (What is his business anyway? Why does he need all those people? And if all he has to do is stare at a person to figure out what they're thinking, why does he need all that equipment?) So, he gets involved with Clara, who has scads of money but is dumb as a post. (They eventually get rid of Clara because she really, really can't act. She just has these enormous LIPS, which they figured would distract the audience from the fact that there was NO PLOT.) Then, Lightman does something stupid with some Peruvians (who weren't from Peru, by the way. They were home-grown Latinos. You could tell by the accents, and the fact that the Sendero Luminoso has been defunct for about 30 years, give or take a decade.) Now Lightman's afraid of losing custody of his daughter (When did he get custody? I thought his ex had custody). So the FBI agent who hangs around the Lightman Group (doing what exactly?) breaks the law not just once, but several times, so Lightman can keep his daughter. (Although, frankly, I'd give her up.  She's an airhead, and that \"deer caught in headlights\" look wears thin after awhile. And why is she ALWAYS hanging around her father's office? Doesn't she go to school?) But the agent doesn't get fired, because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer, withholding evidence, obstructing justice...you know, all those little things you'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies, logic errors and contrivances, the plots got increasingly incoherent, until NOBODY could follow what was going on. Not even the Harvard grad who came up with the idea for the show in the first place. Even if you think you know what the stories are about, you really don't, because nothing the characters do makes any sense...not in this world or the next. (Why get yourself admitted to a mental hospital to have a two-minute conversation with someone.  Why not just go and talk to her?) And when you haven't got a decent story, the obvious thing to do is to keep transmogrifying your main character (all you Buffy fans know what that word means). Now he's a psychologist, now he's a former criminal, now he's Rambo, now he's a gambling addict, now he's an overprotective father, now he's sleeping with that awful Clara with the LIPS god help me ... and then add enough bombs, terrorists, and psychokillers until, you hope, the audience will have completely lost sight of whatever it was the writers thought they were doing when they should have been WRITING.I have to stop, because the more I think about this show the worse it gets . . . and I really like Tim Roth.

Well, I can't put enough emphasis on the word BORING. It sums up most of the shows. The first episode looked promising. The SGC had discovered that dialing a 9th symbol on the Stargate could possibly take them somewhere even further than the Pegasus galaxy. There is a very large team from Earth on another planet at the far reaches of two galaxies, attempting to discover what dialing the 9th symbol leads to? Out of nowhere the planet they are on comes under attack all of a sudden by aliens, and whomever was not beamed up by Scotty had to make a run for it through the gate to the mystery of where the 9th symbol leads to.Upon escaping through the gate, they find themselves on an unmanned alien space ship that is losing power and falling apart. From then on the first couple of episodes are up and down, sometimes they have interesting things going on, but for the most part it is a lot of boring dialog between characters I, and I know many other viewers too, just could not find likable.There is a stubborn scientist, a dork who beat a computer game and was asked to join the group to lend his expertise in being attempt at a non military or scientific perspective, a young girl who is irritating, boring, not in anyway any sort of eye candy, and certainly not a strong female role model like SG1 and Atlantis provided plenty of. The only thing noteworthy of her is her father eats peaces of BLEEP for breakfast. Being that she looks 16, no normal hot blooded male over 18 is going to be watching her for other reasons than acting either... so it's a losing situation either way. Not to mention, she seems to be a BLEEP (rhymes with bore) and the crush the dork has on her is more annoying than anything, because I just don't care if they end up together or not when he's focusing on her during every waking moment he's not being told to hack into the alien ships computer and do something life saving... like unblocking the toilets.Many other characters are just as bad. In fact, no one is good at all. A blonde bimbo always doubting her medical abilities, Chun Li still trying to keep everything political by worrying about paper work rather than except the fact she is a million miles away from home and may never return, the colonel who is always being praised for how good he is supposed to be by his men, who always seem to be on the edge of insanity or blubbering like babies, which the colonel does himself when he's not saying pointless dialog or switching bodies with Richie Valan's and porking his missus. We had such great colonels in SG1 and Atlantis, O'Neil, Carter, Sheppard etc... and now we get a guy who looks as threatening as Carrot Top flicking cotton balls at you. I would even take the last two seasons of Stargate SG1's team over everyone in this show!The rest of the cast pretty much mostly seem to be day players/extras and stand ins just to make it seem like there is plenty of more opportunities for more characters to come in later in the series, but i'm at the end of the first series now, and overall I think I have been entertained by about 15 minutes in total during the whole running of the season. So I just don't care if anyone new comes in for season 2. It blew it's chance by becoming a soap opera rather than everything we came to love about SG1 and Atlantis.I'm not sure it even comes down to bad writing, I think it's the boring cast and how the whole thing is being preformed. The biggest thing that's making it boring is the humor... or should I say, the lack of humor. This show has little to none at all. It's mostly dark hallways and pointless dialog about their personal issues with each other or whether Eli or Rush should be the ones fiddling with alien computer programs to try and activate this and that thing to re-route power to shields, weapons or  a device that can give the annoying chick a new brain. (it happens, sigh). The rest is tedious dialogs of complaining, winging and arguments between them, taking most of the focus off of any sci-fi elements... it clearly stands out this season did not have a big enough budget to design better sets, aliens, or interesting new technologies. There was something for everyone, old and young, sci fi fan or not in SG-1 and Atlantis, this SGU version, it's the worst idea for Days of Our Lives in Space that could have ever been conceived.Excitement is too far and in between. Even when guys like Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks and Amanda Tapping make guest appearances, it just does not make the show better. Everything about it is wrong. It's not just the lack of humor, or adjusting to new cast members, it's the entire atmosphere of the show. With SG-1 and Atlantis, you never knew what was going to happen in the next episode... but watching SG-U, you know what's going to keep happening, and the new things that do happen, all I can say is zzzzzzzzzzzzzz... it was like reliving the end days of WCW Nitro. Repetitive, boring and no imagination. You know from the first few episodes it's always going to be Eluid hacking this, Rush's new theory on that, whats her name boring you to death with how pointless she is, moring interactions and dull emotions by the rest, and a sleazy scene thrown in now and then to try and attract 13 year olds whose mom's put net nanny on their computers.I really can't say it enough about how boring I found the majority of this show to be. Nothing at all worked. I still hold hopes that a Stargate finale movie or season will get financed to wrap everything in SG-1 and Atlantis up. The word about the script that was written to do so mentioned it tied together and wrapped up all 3 Stargate shows... quite frankly, if it does get made, I couldn't care less if SG-U has anything to do with it, as it is the black sheep of the Stargate Universe, the actual universe, not the show with that name.And another thing... the music and soundtrack. The film, SG-1 and Atlantis had amazing scores, full orchestras that provided music that even if you didn't pay much attention to it, it never interfered with the scenes, it built up intensity, set the moods for action, or made you feel emotional when it needed to be... yet this SG-U show seems to have none of that. Not even a decent title sequence theme. It copies the dumb formula from Grey's Anatomy and inserts some stupid, depressing song, and plays it in it's entirety... what where they thinking when they through that would be a good idea? And the so called \"creative\" and edgy soundtrack turned out to be nothing more than irritating noises. One particular episodes music was actually giving me such a headache I ejected the DVD and threw it across the room, never wanting to hear ten minutes of what sounded like a spanner being smashed into a pipe every 7 seconds with a god awful dull slow humming noise... whoever recorded that should be expelled from ever creating music for TV/Movies ever again.There is so much more I could point out on what I hated about this show, but if this information I've mentioned already doesn't convince you this show sucks, or you can understand why I'm far from being alone on hating this show, then nothing will.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "SG-Boo  ( &#865; &#860;&#662; &#865;)&#65279;", "unixReviewTime": 1400198400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4", "asin": "B002S28HUS", "reviewerName": "mirasreviews", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Having begun with later series of \"Midsomer Murders\", which are not very good in my estimation, I hesitated to watch the inaugural series. But I found Series 1, all based on novels by Caroline Graham, to be better than the later fare. The plots are implausible, silly, and too often rely on bonkers villains with bizarre motivations. But the appeal of \"Midsomer Murders\" is its idyllic, quintessentially English villages. Midsomer is a fictional English county with a surprisingly high rate of violent crime. Its administrative center is Causton, where Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and partner Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) are based. They are constantly called out to country villages to investigate gruesome murders that defy their tranquil surroundings. There are 5 episodes in Series 1, which originally aired on Britain's ITV in 1997-1998.The novelist Caroline Graham adapted her own novel for \"Death of a Hollow Man\". The famous Anthony Horowitz wrote the adaptations of \"The Killings at Badger's Drift\" and \"Written in Blood.\" Douglas Watkinson wrote screenplays for \"Faithful unto Death\" and \"Death in Disguise\". Jeremy Siberston and Baz Taylor directed the episodes. The iconically odd theme music, that sounds more suited to sci-fi/horror, was written by Jim Parker. Series 1 bests the later series, simply because its characters have more personality. DS Troy is young and crude, a bit of a smart alec, not hapless or shy as he is in later series. DCI Barnaby makes fun of Troy's tendency to jump to conclusions...and his terrible driving. Neither man has much regard for the law or citizens' rights, unfortunately. They are chronic trespassers.Tom Barnaby is a stereotypical meat-and-potatoes man with a quaint middle-class home and homemaker wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) who teases her husband about his busy schedule. He's a little more caustic than in later series, but he's meant to come across as traditional but fair. Laura Howard, the actress who plays the Barnaby's grown daughter Cully, is so much more appealing here than in later series that it defies explanation. She is saccharine and precious in Series 4 and 5, and she looks terrible. What happened to her? That may be the real mystery of Midsomer. Dr. George Bullard (Barry Jackson), the competent and sensible pathologist, is another recurring character. Four stars might be too high a rating for a series with such daft plots, but Series 1 compares favorably to later series, a distinction it owes to characters with stronger personalities. It's as if the characters were un-written in later series rather than built upon.The episodes are:In a \"The Killings at Badger's Drift\", the elderly Emily Simpson (Renee Asherton) stumbles upon some hanky panky in the woods and is found dead of a broken neck in her home later that day. She made a call to a local help line just before she died, and DCI Barnaby suspects foul play. Mrs. Iris Rainbird (Elizabeth Spriggs) has a perfect view from her home of all that goes on in the wood and uses it to great advantage. She and her undertaker son Dennis (Richard Cant) have a very lucrative blackmailing business. Two years prior, a woman named Annabella Trace was shot to death accidentally during a bird shoot in those woods. Her widower Henry (Julian Glover) is about to remarry to his young ward Katherine Lacey (Emily Mortimer). As Miss Simpson mentioned a \"Bella\" on the phone before she died, DCI Barnaby wonders if the deaths might be related.The Midsomer Worthy Writer's Circle invites best-selling author Max Jennings (John Shrapnel) to speak at their meeting in \"Written in Blood\". Unbeknownst to most members of the group, Jennings consents because he knows one of them: Gerald Hadleigh (Robert Swann), a man who seems to have no past but who despises Jennings. Hadleigh asks Amy Lyddiard (Joanna David) to make sure he is never left alone with Jennings, but she does not succeed. Hadleigh's housekeeper finds him bludgeoned to death the next morning. The first mystery is that of Gerald Hadleigh's identity. The second is who, apart from Jennings, would have motive to kill him. Laura Hutton, owner of a local antique shop, had an unrequited love for him. Amy Lyddiard's domineering sister-in-law Honoria (Anna Massey) has discovered something in an old tabloid that fascinates her.A woman of deep religious convictions but little social contact, Agnes Gray, is found bludgeoned to death and dumped in the river in \"Death of a Hollow Man\". Meanwhile, Joyce Barnaby (Jane Wymark) is participating in a production of \"Amadeus\" put on by the local drama group \"The Causton Players\". None of the players get along, least of all the delusional director Harold Winstanley (Bernard Hepton), whose long-ago success has given him an insufferable sense of entitlement. The lead is played by caustic businessman Esslyn Carmichael (Nicholas Le Provost), whose new young wife Kitty (Debra Stephenson) is also in the cast, as is his bitterly jealous ex-wife Rosa (Sarah Badel). When an actor dies on stage in a gruesome manner, DCI Barnaby and DS Troy must wade through the romantic entanglements and rivalries of a discordant cast and crew.\"Faithful unto Death\" begins as DCI Barnaby quells an argument between his friend Catherine Bullard (Alwyne Taylor) and Gray Patterson (Mark Bazely). Mrs. Bullard and several other members of the community invested in a project to restore a local mill organized by Alan Hollingsworth (Roger Allam). Patterson was his business partner. The project is defunct, and the investors are trying to recover their money. Hollingsworth's wife Simone (Lesley Vickerage) disappears, and DCI Barnaby suspects kidnapping. He and Troy keep an eye on Hollingsworth from the home of Reg (Paul Chapman), the crooked accountant behind the mill finances, and Felicity Buckley (Michele Dotrice), an investor, whose daughter Brenda (Sophie Stanton) has an all-consuming crush on Hollingsworth. Solving the mystery proves not to be the biggest obstacle to justice.A man dies when he falls down the stairs in a new-age commune called The Lodge of the Golden Windhorse in \"Death in Disguise\". One of the young acolytes, Chris Wainwright (Stephen Moyer) believes it may not have been an accident after a cannonball dislodges itself from the roof and nearly hits him. May Cuttle (Judy Cornwell), a woman who has spells of past life regressions in which she is Julius Caesar's food taster, agrees after overhearing a cryptic conversation involving the commune's \"master\" Ian Craigie (Michael Feast), and they both take their suspicions to DCI Barnaby. The daughter (Anna Bolt) of wealthy and caustic businessman Guy Gamelin (Miles Anderson) is also at the commune, providing monetary motive for murder.

Can't anyone come up with anything new and original? But when the 'reboot' is as good as \"Star Trek\", I kind of wish J.J. Abrams was at the helm of them all. His new film adds richness and depth to a once ailing mythology bringing it back to life by going back to the beginning.\"Star Trek\" introduces us to Kirk (Chris Pine, \"Bottle Shock\"), Spock (Zachary Quinto, TV's \"Heroes\"), Bones (Karl Urban), McCoy (Simon Pegg, \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Hot Fuzz\", \"Run, Fatboy, Run\"), Sulu (John Cho, \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle\"), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin, \"Alpha Dog\") and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana, \"Drumline) on the first voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise. As this is \"Star Trek: Origins\", if you will, writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann (\"Transformers\", \"Cloverfield\") and director J.J. Abrams (TV's \"Lost\" and \"Alias\", \"Mission Impossible III\", \"Cloverfield\") have taken some liberties with the timeline and stayed true to other parts of the mythology. What this mix accomplishes is to give us a fresh take on these characters, allowing us to see how they got started and how they would become what they would become.A rebellious kid, Jim Kirk (Pine) likes to race vehicles he doesn't own in his Iowa hometown. One day, he enters a bar filled with Starfleet Cadets and starts hitting on a beautiful woman. But Uhuru (Saldana) isn't interested and asks him to leave. A fight quickly develops and Kirk gets a bloody nose before Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) puts and end to the bar brawl. He sits Kirk down and explains he knows about him, about his father and challenges Kirk to join Starfleet and do better than his dad did. His dad died trying to save as many lives as possible when the U.S.S. Kelvin was under attack. The next morning, Kirk takes up the challenge and meets McCoy (Urban) a doctor who is also headed to Starfleet for training. Three years later, Kirk is taking the infamous Kobayashi Morou test again. And passes. Much to the astonishment of the test's creator, Commander Spock (Quinto), causing the two to become, at best, rivals. Just as an academic tribunal is called to investigate the charges against Kirk, Starfleet receives a distress signal from Vulcan. They quickly dispatch the recruits to new ships and eventually, everyone ends up on the Enterprise under Captain Pike's leadership. As they head out to assist the other star ships, Kirk becomes convinced they are about to enter an ambush and proves to be right. A Romulan mining vessel, led by Nero (Eric Bana, \"Hulk\", the upcoming \"Funny People\") is drilling into the core of Vulcan, causing seismic activity and he has just blown up the rest of the ships. The Enterprise takes evasive action, but Pike is soon summoned to the enemy vessel leaving Commander Spock in charge. He appoints Kirk his First Officer. The first order of business is to stop the drill and then save the Captain. But Nero proves a persistent villain and when he reveals what he really wants, everyone kicks into overdrive and start working together, becoming the team we all remember. Will Kirk and Spock learn to work together? Will everyone find their place on the Enterprise? Will this vessel staffed largely by new recruits be able to fight off the bent-on-revenge Nero?Abrams has achieved the right balance of reverence to the characters and universe of these people while taking them to new and exciting places, bringing them alive for a new generation. It's really quite remarkable work when you think about all of the other needless remakes and reboots littering the Hollywood landscape.All of the characters seem to have the trademark mannerisms of the television cast. Pine develops a telling swagger and bravado, very similar to William Shatner's portrayal of the role. More importantly, he doesn't display these mannerisms from the beginning; he grows into them as he develops the courage and bravery he will become known for. A friend saw a copy of Entertainment Weekly with Quinto as Spock on the cover sitting on my desk. \"How do you feel about them using a CGI character in this film?\" After a brief conversation, I learned he felt the character had to be CGI because he looked so similar to Leonard Nimoy's Spock, only a lot younger. I explained that an actor was playing the role and he was just amazed. Quinto was, reportedly, the first person hired for the film and he does an excellent job of making the character his own, while paying homage to Nimoy. Karl Urban seems to have a lot of fun paying the perpetually cross Dr. Bones McCoy, again adopting and paying homage to many of the character quirks DeForest Kelly used in his portrayal. Zoe Saldana is good as Uhuru. She and Kirk meet in the bar the night before they leave to join Starfleet and he continues to pine for her throughout the film. Her Uhuru is a little more fully integrated into the plot, a little more active, involving herself with Kirk and Spock. Anton Yelchin has some fun moments as the very young Chekhov. And John Cho. Well known for silly, raunchy comedies shows he may have some action chops on him. Sulu is also new to the Enterprise and has some growing pains. When Captain Pine picks Kirk and Sulu to lead a mission to stop a Romulan drilling device, they team up on a pretty terrifying and thrilling mission. And Sulu's unique skill set quickly comes in to play.And that, is your crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Wait! Who am I forgetting? Ah yes, Scotty. Scotty is played by Simon Pegg, a British comedian who stars in a series of memorable films he co-wrote and co-directed (the best is \"Shaun of the Dead\") and he is clearly having a lot of fun playing the role. At one point, he shouts James Doohan's trademark phrase \"I'm giving her all she's got\" and it's nice to hear it even if it seems drowned out by the cacophony surrounding their battle. It is also interesting to see how Scotty joins the crew as he isn't on the ship when it leaves Starfleet.Bruce Greenwood plays Captain Pine, the original commander of the new U.S.S. Enterprise. He does a good job displaying the right mixture of knowledge, leadership and mentoring to his young crew. More importantly, this is Abrams way of giving a little wink and a nod to the fact the original television series pilot was filmed with Captain Pine, not Kirk. The network didn't like it and Gene Rodenberry recast the role making William Shatner Captain Kirk. This pilot episode would eventually become the basis for a later two-part episode reusing much of the footage in flashback. An interesting move on both Rodenberry and Abrams' part.Eric Bana plays Nero, once a simple miner trying to make a life for he and his expectant wife, who is now so hell-bent on revenge, he will destroy entire planets to achieve his goal. He is good, surprisingly, and displays both the right level of menace and humanity as displayed through his reasons for wanting to extract revenge. Bana was once the next big thing and starred in a series of films, none of which ever achieved much critical praise or box office clout. He is more interesting as the villain in this film than he was as the \"Hulk\" in the version directed by Ang Lee. He is following this film with a role in \"Funny People\", the new film from Judd Apatow starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann and Jonah Hill.And I don't think I'm spoiling anything for anyone by mentioning that Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as Spock. It is sort of thrilling to see him return to such an iconic role. Better yet, rather than a quick cameo, his appearance plays an integral role in the plot and he has a significant amount of screen time.Perhaps best of all, none of the characters goes without creating at least one moment of levity. It is nice to see that while the material is taken very seriously, they also recognize we can have a bit of humor, to lighten up the serious nature of the story. Just a little.Abrams has created a plot involving black holes, time travel (allowing him to include Nimoy) and revenge. It is an involving, complicated story that makes good use of the characters, their mythology and their backgrounds. It's a great ride and an almost perfect film.I read an article about the making of this film and Abrams noted that when he was researching the material and watching the episodes of the television series, he noticed a lot of scenes had lens flares in front of the character's faces. This is yet another aspect Abrams chose to pay tribute to. And it is an interesting visual device the first dozen times or so. But when this continues throughout the entire film, sometimes more than once in a scene, it becomes distracting and annoying. In almost every scene, a bright light or a lens flare partially obscures at least one character's face for a few seconds before disappearing or lowering to return again. A few times, this is used as a transitional device, but more often than not, it simply becomes distracting.Despite this one annoying (and constant) distraction, Abrams and his writing team have done an amazing job of bringing life back to familiar characters and a familiar mythology that we don't have to give up just yet. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the two sequels.

Reed credits the inspiration for the show to a personal experience in which he was unable to muster up the charisma to hit on a beautiful woman; he later fantasized about a suave, debonair spy who would always have the right moves.  I have absolutely fallen in love with \"Archer;\" I can't get enough of the continuous wit and exceptionally clever dialog.  Unlike other animated shows, \"Archer\" utilizes complex plotting as well as character development, allowing viewers to watch and rewatch episodes without sacrificing entertainment value.  I am personally humbled by the various cultural references employed by the writers--it just goes to show how involved intellect must be in creating comedy.  I fully understand that much of the show's content may be deemed offensive to some viewers, so to enjoy it, it's best to keep in mind that \"Archer\" is written in a satirical manner.  It is fair to warn, however, that the series earns its TV/MA rating quite well through use of crude language, violence, and sexual situations; basically, it's probably not suitable for children or anyone who isn't a fan of that sort of comedy.The storyline centers around Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin) who is the sort of spy Reed had imagined, only with a few extra character `flaws'--he is pretty much a sociopath.  Despite bearing the codename Duchess, Archer is considered the world's most dangerous spy; were he not absorbed with promiscuity, alcoholism, expensive toys and tactlenecks, he might also be considered the world's best spy.  Archer works for his self-centered and emotionally distant mother, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), at the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) based in New York City.  Fellow ISIS employees include agent Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), comptroller Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), agent Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), HR Director Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Head of Applied Research Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates), ISIS whipping-boy Brett Buckley (Neal Holman), and nut-job secretary Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer).  Other recurring cast-members include:  ODIN agent Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) and Archer's valet, Woodhouse (George Coe; Roy McCrery in flashbacks).Season 1 Guest Stars:  mole agent Crenshaw aka Kremenski (Shelly Desai), Cuban agent Charles (Thomas Lennon), Cuban agent Rudy (R. Ben Garant), UN Intelligence Committee Chairman Torvald Utne (Jeffrey Tambor), head of ODIN Len Trexler (Jeffrey Tambor), freelance assassin Elke Hubsch aka \"The Needle\" (Audrey Wasilewski), former Cuban spy Ramon Limon (Ron Perlman), German freelance assassin Mannfred (Ren&eacute; Auberjonois), German freelance assassin Uta (Kat Cressida), and double agent Conway Stern (Coby Bell).ARCHER:  THE COMPLETE SEASON ONE--premiered on January 14, 2010 with the episode \"Training Day.\"  The first season focuses on introducing the main characters and their manners of interaction.  The various plots also set in motion a few themes that carry into later seasons; just a few examples:  Who is Archer's father?  Will Lana and Archer get back together?  What will come of the rivalry between Barry and Archer?  Why does Woodhouse take such abuse?SPECIAL FEATURES:  [10 Episodes/2 Discs]  The Original Unaired \"Archer\" Pilot*, Deleted Scenes, Unaired Network Promo, The \"League\" Pilot Episode, \"Louie\" Pilot Episode, and The Making of \"Archer\":  3D Animation, Art Direction, Backgrounds, and Storyboards.EPISODES:Episode 1*:  \"Mole Hunt\"--(unaired pilot)  The season opens on a simulation exercise where Sterling Archer is being interrogated by fellow agent Crenshaw.  We learn Archer's codename, Duchess, is actually an homage to Malory's beloved and deceased Afghan Hound.  When Archer is pressed to settle his ISIS expense account, he fabricates a mole hunt in hopes that fear-mongering will convince Pam to grant him mainframe access.  Once he realizes none of his coworkers are going to help him get into the mainframe, Archer employs his super-spy techniques to break in.  During his after-hours ISIS infiltration, Archer accidentally discovers a real mole, Crenshaw/Kremenski, misappropriating funds for his escape back to Russia.  Now that the fabricated mole, coincidentally, turns out to be real, Archer must use his powers of `classic misdirection' to save ISIS (and settle his expense account).Episode 2:  \"Training Day\"--A drunken Sterling accidentally foils the plans of an IRA suicide bomber, thus saving the `bacon' of an English diplomat (who Archer refers to as Santa Claus).  Lana, to the dismay of Cyril and Malory, appears a little gaga over Archer's knack for heroism.  In order to keep Lana's attention on Cyril, Malory intervenes and orders Archer to train Cyril as an agent; Archer takes it upon himself to prepare Cyril for failure, prostitutes, and other smut.Episode 3:  \"Diversity Hire\"--Due to some recent `vacancies,' ISIS is low on minority agents.  Malory hires Conway Stern, a `double whammy,' to fill the diversity quota as is mandatory for tax deduction status.  Lana, for fear that her continuing tenure as top agent may be threatened, questions Conway's legitimacy as an ISIS agent; Archer focuses on intercepting the possibility that his mother and Conway might engage in a sexual relationship.Episode 4:  \"Killing Utne\"--In order to swindle a lucrative contract, Malory plans a dinner party to seduce Torvald Utne, the chairman of the UN Intelligence Committee.  Even though Sterling is forbidden to bring a date, he runs into Elke Hubsch on the street.  Elke, aka \"The Needle,\" gives Archer the impression that she is `for hire,' but she is actually an undercover assassin tasked with killing Utne.  Meanwhile, Malory has hired Mannfred and Uta (German freelance assassins) to pose as wait-staff; she actually arranges for the fair to pretend to assassinate Utne so that her ISIS agents can foil the plot and save Utne's life, and thereby secure the UN contract.Episode 5:  \"Honeypot\"--Ramon Limon, a Cuban spy, obtains a sex tape that stars Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB, and Malory Archer, head of ISIS.  If the video is leaked, Malory can be charged with treason, which is possibly a ploy by Nikolai to force Malory to defect to Russia.  In order to retrieve the video, Malory gives Ramon her South Beach condo.  Archer is then dispatched to carry out the `honeypot,' which involves Archer attempting to seduce Ramon.  In the meantime, Woodhouse regales undercover Cuban agents, Charles and Rudy, with romantic war stories from his past.Episode 6:  \"Skorpio\"--Lana takes a job recovering stolen missiles from notorious arms dealer Skorpio; the bounty will allow her to remodel her kitchen and the cruise of the French Riviera, aboard Skorpio's super-yacht, will given her a much-needed vacation from clingy boyfriend, Cyril.  Malory tags along for a `conference' that is actually her own romantic cruise aboard a boat with Nikolai Jakov.  Back at ISIS, the crew torments Cyril with thoughts of what Lana is ACTUALLY doing.  When Lana's mission goes south, Archer is dispatched to rescue her.Episode 7:  \"Skytanic\"--The new rigid airship, Excelsior, receives a bomb threat which targets its maiden voyage.  ISIS is contacted to place agents Lana Kane and Sterling Archer aboard in hopes that they can thwart the terror plot.  Malory, jealous that her neighbor Trudy Beakman will on board for Excelsior's premier voyage, uses her connections to con a VIP cabin, thus bumping Trudy from the trip's roster.  Fearing what may come of Lana and Archer sharing a cabin, Cyril sneaks onboard along with Pam and Cheryl; Cheryl continues to blackmail Cyril into sleeping with her.Episode 8:  \"The Rock\"--In hopes of gaining a security contract, Lana and Archer infiltrate San Mariano's palace, exposing any flaws in the security system.  Despite their work, the long-term contract is awarded to rival agency ODIN, headed by Len Trexler.  Cyril reveals to Pam and Cheryl that he has bought a ring and plans to propose to Lana; he is humiliated when the girls laugh at the tiny ring, spurring all ISIS employees to reflect on their meager salaries.  The `drones' form a union and go on strike; Lana, Archer, and Malory are considered `management' because of their more significant incomes.  Because of the strike, Lana and Archer must attempt a mission designed to reap revenge on ODIN and San Mariano without the aid of agency intell and satellite support.Episode 9:  \"Job Offer\"--Lana becomes frustrated when Archer fumbles during the pursuit of Kasparov.  After ODIN swoops in and takes credit for the capture, Barry Dylan (Archer's nemesis) offers Lana a position at ODIN.  Cyril fears Lana may leave him for Barry, so he follows her to Paris for the interview.  When Malory fires Sterling, he seeks employment with ODIN as well; Malory retaliates against her son by blacklisting him.  Archer further antagonizes Barry by sleeping with his fianc&eacute;, Franois, in his new office.  Once ODIN receives the burn notice on Archer, Barry happily accepts the opportunity to assassinate him; Lana has to choose between Archer and her new job.Episode 10:  \"Dial M for Mother\"--Now that Cyril's secret has been exposed, ISIS puts a ban on interoffice relationships.  Lana seeks revenge on the cheating Cyril by sleeping with everyone in the office.  Malory's secret about Sterling's paternity comes into question as well, and the top candidates seem to be Nikolai Jakov of the KGB, Len Trexler of ODIN, and Buddy Rich.  Upset that he may not be Archer's father after all, Nikolai arranges for Mannfred and Uta to capture Sterling and implant a mind-control chip in his brain; Nikolai intends to use the chip to force Archer into killing his mother.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Archer:  The Complete Season One", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A3CN9CCJUNIPKT", "asin": "B0038L1XPO", "reviewerName": "DJ Joe Sixpack", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "\"Parenthood, Season One\". . . .I had started watching \"Parenthood\" when it first broadcast in 2010, but got distracted by another show - \"The Wire,\" perhaps? - and it fell off my radar after the first few weeks. Recently while hitting a lull in my binge-watching, I heard a glowing review on NPR of the series, which praised the ensemble cast and mentioned that the series had been created by producer Jason Katims, who was also the creative force behind the \"Friday Night Lights\" series. That got my attention.  So, I decided to go for it, and delve into \"Parenthood\" as well.Having just finished Season 1-3, I am definitely hooked, though there are a few minor details that keep getting in the way.The show is generally pretty strong... Although new plot elements are sometimes introduced with a slightly forced feel (\"Haddie will now have a black boyfriend. Amber will develop an Attitude Problem.\") and are often dropped rather quickly (\"Things are OK now.\") Probably this is more a reflection of the difference between writing for a weekly TV audience, as opposed to viewers who binge-watch entire seasons on DVD - three weeks as opposed to three hours makes a big difference in how story arcs play out, and whether they \"feel real\" or not.Overall, though, the show is remarkable for its depth and honesty in exploring an amazing range of topics, showing a frankness about the difficulties of parenting, of negotiating sexuality and romance at a variety of ages, and about mental health and disability issues such as substance abuse and autism, all dealt with with a frankness that is surprising for network TV.  Even with its occasional dramatic flaws, the show has a profound authenticity: like many viewers, my wife and I often found ourselves nodding and saying, \"yep! that happened to us!\"A universal theme among the large cast is of discovering and re-shaping one's identity, an issue that comes up at every age on a variety of fronts: teenagers test boundaries and take risks, parents set boundaries and often make mistakes, retired couples find that old issues still need to be ironed out, and can put even seemingly rock-solid relationships at risk. For each character new choices come up constantly, challenging established self-images and social roles. The ramifications of \"parenthood\" are explored in every generation, on a variety of levels: the youngest children innocently mirror their parents while teenage siblings are constantly in conflict with these same parents and struggle to establish their own autonomy, while the four grown-up siblings in the Braverman family are perpetually tested by parental responsibilities, and even by their relationships to their own parents. Meanwhile, Grandma and Grandpa have their own roles to play for all these children and grandchildren, and even their own issues with their own parents. (In one poignant episode, the family patriarch, played by Craig T. Nelson, agonizes about his need to connect emotionally with his own distant, disapproving 86-year old mother: it never stops, really.)My criticisms mostly have to do with the show's choice of locale: supposedly this is all taking place in Berkeley, California, a city I am quite familiar with. Why Jason Katims decided to place the show there is a little mysterious, given his apparent lack of knowledge about the town. To start with, \"Parenthood\" is constantly geographically challenged when it comes to Berkeley and the Bay Area: one night the teenagers sneak out to go to a fraternity party \"across the Bay,\" which is ridiculous, since all the frat houses are here in Berkeley, not in SF or Marin. Likewise in another early episode, one kids' parents have to drive to Fremont (which is like fifteen miles away, all horrible freeway driving) to pick up a birthday cake, which is nuts since there are dozens of great bakeries in Berkeley itself, a town that is possibly the food snob capitol of America. (The long drive was just a plot device to get the parents out of the party scenes...) Visually it's all wrong as well: the show is not actually filmed in Berkeley, and characters frequently refer to locations that don't exist, such as \"the corner of College and 8th\" while exterior shots -- street scenes, houses -- almost always look like LA. (On occasion you can spot LA landmarks in the background, such as the Caioti pizza restaurant in Laurel Village... Likewise, there are frequent scenes of busy intersections with strip-mall backgrounds that you simply don't see in NIMBY-centric, no-growth Berkeley.)Of course, that's all small-ball nitpicking to most viewers - the differences between urban planning in Northern California vs. Southern California don't mean much to viewers in Iowa, but the show also has a big problem thematically. \"Berkeley\" is often used as a pop-culture shorthand for something \"weird\" or alterna and totally out of the mainstream, for ethnic diversity and political activism.  But there is very little in \"Parenthood\" that merits such a distinction. Yeah, there are two interracial couples and one family has a kid with Aspergers, but it's not like that stuff isn't happening pretty much everywhere in America anyway.Meanwhile, in supposedly wacky, alterna Berkeley, we see practically no people of color other than the two African-American love interests. A couple of Asian-Americans have cameos as teachers or school parents, one Latino guy who works in a warehouse semi-dates one of the Braverman sisters, but vanishes after a couple of episodes. In Season Three we finally have one Latina woman with depth emerge - a pregnant, working-class teenager who offers to let one of the couples adopt her baby -- but her character is semi-stereotyped and meanwhile no Latinos or Asian-American professionals seem to be in the Braverman orbit. Really? This big, hip Berkeley family and they don't have *any* friends who are people of color, other than the two black people they fall in love with? For real?Of these two love interests, the character of Jasmine, played by Joy Bryant, is by far the strongest: she emerges as a fully-formed, multi-dimensional person, fluent and comfortable in both \"black\" and \"white\" culture, and seems like a completely authentic, realistic, contemporary Bay Area person. Jasmine exists as an unapologetic equal to the other characters in the predominantly white cast and she's never given any stupid, forced, stereotypical issues that revolve around her race -- she doesn't preach about race issues, she doesn't have a drug problem or a chip on her shoulder about anything, she doesn't go through any of the same-old tiresome motions of black-culture-as-seen-by-Hollywood.  It's very refreshing.In contrast, the kid-from-the-hood Alex, as played by Michael B. Jordan (an alumnus of \"Friday Night Lights\") is disappointing. He dates the high-school aged Haddie, and while their courtship provides a foil for the questionable overreactions of Haddie's parents, the relationship goes nowhere. Alex is a big bundle of troubles -- though amazingly polite and a perfect gentleman, he is economically disadvantaged, a recovering alcoholic, and so morally pure and self-sacrificing that he finally breaks up with Haddie rather than drag her down with his own real-world worries, just as she's just starting out on her own life. Their relationship had glimmers of great potential - it would have been so cool if the writers just made it work out, rather than have it turn into some big over-the-top melodrama, but the show's producers weren't able to hit that particular note of restraint. Oh, well.Finally, I have a big, big, big problem with the fact that, having finished the third season, we still haven't seen one single gay or lesbian character on the whole show, not even a random gay parent at any of the public and private schools the various Braverman kids attend. \"Oh, but this is a show about parenting,\" some may say. \"Why would you have gay characters on a show like that?\"  Um, hello?  2014 calling. Not all parents are heterosexual. Your show is supposedly set in Berkeley. This is your big chance to \"be Berkeley\": there are nothing BUT gay parents in Berkeley, California. So where are they on \"Parenthood?\" Seriously: WTF?Overall, though, this is an excellent series which explores a wide range of contemporary family issues, and though the orientation is pretty lily-white and upper-ish middle-class, many of the themes are fairly universal and may strike a chord with a wide range of viewers. In particular, the portrayal of Max, an adolescent boy with Asperger's syndrome, is a breakthrough for mainstream television, and may be a comfort to families coping with various kinds of autism or other behavioral spectrum disabilities. Max's diagnosis was a central focus of Season One, and slips in and out of focus in S2 and S3. While the writers could probably hammer it home a little bit more, they don't shy away from the very real and very difficult issues at hand.Producer Jason Katim's child apparently has Aspergers, so there are scene here that will ring true because they are true: I think these may resonate mostly with families that have similar issues. While I understand the impulse to underplay some of the heartbreaking dysfunctions in order to make the show \"play\" better for a mainstream audience, I think ultimately it might be stronger dramatically to show even more of Max's problems. This is particularly true of his outbursts and tantrums, a problem that has more to do with neurology (wiring) than with \"bad parenting\" which is what folks on the outside often think is happening. Still, seeing these issues portrayed realistically on network TV is pretty profound, and remains one of the elements that makes \"Parenthood\" stand out. Also, there are lots of great performances, with my personal favorites being actors Joy Bryant, Bonnie Bedelia, Sam Jaeger, Mae Whitman, Tina Lifford, Max Burkholder and Jason Ritter, pretty much in that order. And Craig T. Russell's performance as the grandad is also a nice surprise. It's a good show - if you're on the fence, check it out.

There are a few episodes I think are a little weak like \"Medicinal Fried Chicken,\" \"Poor and Stupid,\" \"Insheeption,\" and \"Creme Fraiche.\"  But what the season may lack in consistency, it makes up for in WOW moments.  I don't think I've ever been as blown away watching an animated show than I was seeing the uncovering of the truth of Cartman's father on \"201.\"  \"Mysterion Rises\" also gave me a \"Of course!  It's so obvious!\" moment.  This season also offers quite a few old school Looney Tunes cartoon references that brought back childhood memories.  Season 14 was good though not as consistently brilliant as past seasons.  I am reducing the score an extra star because of the egregious censoring of \"201\"--one of the most exciting SP episodes ever.  What could Kyle and the others at the end possibly be saying to warrant the entire thing being bleeped out?  And the bleeping of every mention of Mohammad is very annoying and is a bit baffling considering his name was not bleeped at all in \"200.\"  Why not bleep it on this DVD if it is so dangerous?  Still, I guess we are lucky that this episode is included at all since it is not available online and hasn't been aired on Comedy Central since.Disc 1:\"Sexual Healing\"--So clever.  Saying what a lot of people think went down in the Tiger Woods's household, but doing it in X-Box EA Sports form and then bringing in the sex addiction theme with Ben Roethlisberger, Bill Clinton, Charlie Sheen, etc, is just brilliant.\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\"--The boys are disappointed by a supposed controversial book assigned in school (the one that \"made a guy shoot the king of hippies\" according to Cartman), so they write their own.  Afraid of getting in trouble, they credit the book to Butters who is elevated to genius for his masterpiece in sociopolitical commentary and uncontrolled vomiting.  It's funny how readers interpret the disgusting passages.  Gross.\"Medicinal Fried Chicken\"--KFCs are being replaced by medicinal cannabis stores.  Randy and his friends purposely get testicular cancer so they can partake.  This episode is overly silly with the men bouncing on their balls like hippity hops.  Meanwhile, Cartman resorts to the black market to get his KFC fix.\"You Have 0 Friends\"--Despite his resistance, Stan's friends sign him up with a Face Book account and he is deluged with demands from \"friends\".  Stan finds that deleting a FB profile is tougher than he thought.  Meanwhile, the always sympathetic Kyle befriends a lonely boy who has no friends and finds that his own FB stock falls as a result thanks to Eric \"Kramer\" Cartman.\"200\"--This episode and the sequel blew me away back when they first aired.  In this part, Tom Cruise and all the celebrities defamed in South Park get together and demand to see Mohammad, who is the only person they know susceptible to ridicule, so they can get his goo.  They then get competition from gingers.  In another storyline, Jennifer Lopez (a.k.a. Mitch Conner) gets Mr. Hat to admit to Cartman that there was a cover-up pertaining to the identity of his father.  A LOT of past characters show up in these episodes which is a real treat for long-time SP fans.Disc 2:\"201\"--The continuation of \"200\".  I will not give away the ending, but it blew me away when I saw it when it first aired.  I said, \"No Way!\" out loud even though I was watching it by myself.  Brilliant!  Controversy surrounds the \"I learned something today\" speeches at the end as Comedy Central decided to bleep them out.  They are still bleeped out on this DVD.  I thought it was done on purpose when I first saw it, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone were actually angry it was done that way and a text statement from them is included at the beginning of this episode.\"Crippled Summer\"--A hilarious take-off of the \"Intervention\" TV series featuring Towlie\" \"I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!...Oh, it IS Wednesday.\"  Also, a Looney Tunes treatment is given to a camp for handicapped kids where Nathan (the steroid seller in \"Up the Down Steroid\") keeps trying to get revenge on popular Jimmy, but his plans keep backfiring on him thanks to a dopey sidekick.\"Poor And Stupid\"--Cartman thinks he can't fulfill his dream of being a great NASCAR driver because he is not poor and stupid.  He thus gives away all his money and eats Vagisil to impede his short-term memory.\"It's A Jersey Thing\"--South Park (as well as the eastern half of the country) is being invaded by New Jerseyites.  It gets so bad, they contact al-Qaeda for help.  In this episode, viewers find out Sheila Broflovski is from Jersey (big surprise, huh?) and her son Kyle was conceived there, meaning he is struck by the three J's, according to Cartman, Jerseyite, Jewish, Jinger.  Fans of \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" and \"Jersey Shore\" will appreciate this episode.\"Insheeption\"--This is a take-off on the TV series \"Hoarders\".  Those shows are often funny anyway in a pathetic way, but I don't think SP took advantage of the possibilities.  A sheep herder?  And the hoarding theme is replaced by the dream/memory sequence.  This episode is also taken from the film \"Inception\" (hence the title) and the College Humor parody of \"Inception\" (so much so, it lead to an apology from Parker and Stone).  Stan's mom sums up this episode very well: \"Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool.\" On a side note, that bully who torments a young Mr. Mackey looks like the kid in \"Eight Is Enough.\"Disc 3:\"Coon 2: Hindsight\"--The Coon and his super hero friends keep getting overshadowed by Captain Hindsight, \"the hero of the modern age,\" who only tells people what should have been done to prevent disasters after they've happened. When he becomes the hero of the Gulf oil spill, Cartman tries to recruit him by resorting to blackmail.  Meanwhile, BP's continuous drilling causes increasing horrors for the environment and humanity.  The other members of Coon and Friends are fed up with Cartman's violent, overbearing tactics and kick him out of the union.\"Mysterion Rises\"--In this episode, we find out the identity of Mysterion (if it wasn't known before) and his real power.  When I saw this part I was blown away, \"Of course!  It all makes sense now!\"  Cartman joins forces with the evil Cthulhu to get back at his former \"friends.\"  Mysterion tries to see if there is a connection between the Cult of Cthulhu and his power.  I like the parody of the Lebron James commercial.  The Cthulhu song is hilarious.\"Coon Vs. Coon & Friends\"--In this final installment of the three-parter, Cartman and Cthulhu banish Cartman's former friends to the Nightmare City of R'lyeh while they wreak havoc to make the world a better place...for Cartman.  Mysterion takes action to stop them but an unsuspected hero may be the one to save the day.  I like Cartman's comic book summary of the story where he pleads with his \"evil\" friends (he thinks he's the good guy, of course) to \"Go with Christ.\" Cartman also does a parody of that cartoon where the little kitten kneads and curls up on the back of the bulldog.  I remember that cartoon from my kid days.\"Creme Fraiche\"--Randy becomes obsessed with cooking shows in a sexual way while his wife Sharon gets out her frustrations using the shake weight.

But you should know what you're NOT getting, in order to avoid disappointment.I had seen only the trailer and good reviews on Amazon. I was expecting more of an action-y British gangster film. But it's not really an action film -- although MUCH happens -- and that's a *good* thing. It is devilishly suspenseful.The first ten minutes are masterful. They quickly becoming horrifyingly suspenseful -- totally without dialogue. (The first line of dialogue is said at approx 6 min in.) That sounds boring, but it is the exact opposite: riveting. The story begins, and you must pay attention. The more attention you pay, the more compelling it becomes. This is *not* a movie to have on in the background while you clear off the kitchen table or do dishes. (My boyfriend does this all the time. It drives me nuts because he'll say, \"Eh, I didn't think [insert movie title] was that good\" and I'll say, \"Well, you really didn't watch it, you mostly had your back to it!\" And then when I make him sit down and watch movies I've liked, he'll say, \"I totally didn't get that the first time I saw it\" and I'm like, \"Yeah, 'cause you didn't *see* it!!\" Argh.)This is a movie to make popcorn for and sit down to really *watch* -- don't answer your phone, don't play with your tablet, make sure any kids are in bed and can't disturb you.The actions of the two men in preparation to commit a serious crime heighten the suspense. The supplies they gather are curious, then intriguing, then horrifying in their implications. The spaces in which they work are large with wide camera angles. Over time, throughout the film, both the spaces and camera angles slowly shrink, adding a visual claustrophobia to the psychological tension as the film progresses.The soundtrack is like a fourth character (and I'd like to buy it). It never gives things away, but alternates setting the mood with punctuating the plot twists and shifting dynamics. Pure music -- synthesizer-based modern sounds alternating with haunting organic notes of solo viola or cello -- evokes moods and heightens the emotion of unexpected twists, moments of pathos, shifts of alliance. It doesn't use pop music to buttress lousy chemistry or muddy action.This movie is not what the trailer implies. Truly unexpected plot twists alternate with slow reveals of the relationship dynamics, character back-stories (without flashbacks), and shifting alliances. Every time I thought I knew what would happen, who the characters were, what they were about to do -- I was wrong. As a jaded and cynical movie fan, and tired of predictable, cliche-ish, dumbed down movies, I found this movie fiendishly fun to try to figure out -- and I never really succeeded.Gemma Arterton's Alice is integral to the plot. She does a great job, she definitely holds her own -- but she by no means carries the film by herself, as the Amazon summary says. It's truly an ensemble, albeit a small one of only three people. The two male leads were gripping to watch. Eddie Marsan is amazing as Vic. (He was Inspector Lestrade from Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes reboots; he was also in two of the Channel 4 Red Ridings, and in the BBC's Little Dorrit). Vic's evolution is unexpected, believable, brilliantly done, and (by the end) surprisingly sympathetic. Martin Compston was new to me (I never watched Monarch of the Glen). But he's fantastic as the (initially) inexplicably conflicted Danny, seemingly one-down in the criminal partnership. In fact, the acting by both male leads is so good, your sympathy shifts back and forth from the obviously sympathetic victim character Alice to the two males, who initially are totally unsympathetic (because you think you know who they are and what they're about to do).The Disappearance of Alice Creed is not a \"big\" film with crashing violence and lots of guns and explosions. It's one of those films where the implied violence is almost as devastating as the violence that *is* committed. Like David Cronenberg's films, when violence or action occurs in this film, it *means* something: it has consequences -- it's not just there for vicarious and bloodless audience thrills. And although this movie fraks with you, it's not a conventional mind-frak movie, either. It's definitely a psychological thriller.Don't view this movie expecting Sexy Beast or In Bruges or a Guy Ritchie movie -- or even Layer Cake, with which it has some kinship psychologically and perhaps morally (but it never tries to be as consciously cool as Layer Cake). The Disappearance of Alice Creed has more in common thematically with the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple or No Country For Old Men, or with Carl Franklin's thriller One False Move. It's deadly serious about itself and that pays off in how unique and authentic the plot and characters feel. It's up to you whether you find the ending uplifting or bleak, a morality tale or an inevitability.WARNING: Stick through the first half hour/forty minutes, even if it looks/feels like it's about to become cheap Hollywood torture porn. It isn't. It's a much better and smarter film than that. By smart, I do not mean clever like a Guy Ritchie film is clever. (Not that there is anything wrong with that: I love Ritchie's films.) I mean, the entire thing could have easily been B-movie material -- but the script, the directing, the acting, and the execution elevate it way above a B-movie.There is a lot of female nudity, but I did not find it gratuitous (there's also a good amount of corresponding male nudity, under different circumstances). It's typically British matter-of-fact nudity. The female nudity serves the plot and heightens the vulnerability of the victim, but, as a woman, I found it to be as tastefully done as possible under the circumstances. If this had been made in Hollywood, the nudity would have been far greater, far more gratuitous, and much more like B-movie torture-porn. Fortunately, it wasn't made in Hollywood -- one of the reasons why it's so good.In a completely unintentional way I'm sure, I almost find The Disappearance of Alice Creed to thumb its nose at your average Hollywood thriller. It shows how good a movie can be when you focus on script, plot, acting, and direction -- to the exclusion of focusing on butts-in-seats and opening weekends, or trying to tweak those with focus groups and test screenings.The DVD extras are decent. Haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but the dual-screen comparison of the storyboards with the actual film was interesting and shows how well they adhered to the original visual conception. The outtakes are funny moments of the actors forgetting their lines or being unable to get past a fit of giggles (the guys, surprisingly). I watched the outtakes mostly to assure myself that nothing really bad happened to any of the actors -- that's how authentic and compelling the plot and characters are! I feel silly admitting that, but the first third of the movie is rather knuckle-whitening to sit through, especially as a woman -- you really fear the worst for Alice.Also: as with many British films, I had to watch it the first time with the subtitles on, or I wouldn't have understand some of the dialogue. I recommend this to non-British viewers unfamiliar with the accents of various parts of the UK. My second and third viewings, I didn't need the subtitles. (You won't get many subtitles for the first ten minutes, because there is no dialogue.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "fiendishly suspenseful, with truly unexpected plot twists; NOT an action/gangster film, but a psychological thriller", "unixReviewTime": 1373760000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A34GZPHWYPSY2T", "asin": "B0041R9PX6", "reviewerName": "E.

While I had a long-standing desire to read the book, I hadn't heard of the concordant documentary and was anxious to see it when I did hear about it.Before I go on, let me regale you with the latest shill's message to me regarding this film: \"It is your assertions of racism, etc. that are anti-intellectual. I could, in fact argue that YOUR discussion of \"Black names\" reflects a rather insidious degree of bigotry. In addition, your criticisms of the quality of the data are amazingly uninformed.\"WOW. Sell a lot of books this way, do you? By insulting an honest reviewer, then demanding back-up evidence? This is a REVIEW, not a doctoral thesis. The idiots who made this film have the burden - not I. Mine is onerous enough writing to audiences filled with readers like YOU. And the filmmakers are the ones who raise the whole issue of \"black\" names, not I. And that is what you can expect from a film like this.The film is a huge let-down; it certainly steered me away from the desire to read the book. I've come to the conclusion that the appellation \"rogue economist\" (as Levitt calls himself) is a big red flag with Sarah Palin's silhouette on it.Full of somewhat interesting but ultimately useless and mildly offensive trivia, the documentary's biggest mystery is why several directors were hired to film the various segments. Some of the segments are downright insulting to the intelligence.In a word, stupid. Or, in another word, Wallywood. So here are the basic parts of this broken machine:REALTORS ROBBING CLIENTS: Levitt and Dubner yammer about the way realtors rip off their clients in the good old American home-selling scheme. While I found it informative, it could have been done more briefly and a lot more deeply.CHILDREN'S NAMES: This is about whether a child's name will affect that child's success later in life. It seems Levitt's whole point is to show how certain names could lead white girls to a stripper's life. I found this segment racist, aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names, and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs. I doubt that is only because of the names the black community chooses but this film insists it is. In any case, I do not need statistics to explain that to me: I am half black.However, Levitt (the apparent heavy-lifter in all the fact-finding) tells us more: did you know that among rich white folk, the most popular names for girls used to be Jessica, Lauren, Ashley, Sarah and Emily? Among \"the Wal~Mart crowd\" (their term, not mine), the most popular names were Ashley (\"Trashley\"), Jessica, Amanda, Samantha and Brittney.I was having a hard time understanding how the white strippers relate to the problems of the black community and vice-versa, but there you are. Apparently, these two stalwart researchers also claim that the name Tyrone \"is a black name.\" I have news for you: it is not a \"black\" name. The only thing in the world that is \"black\" in this context is the skin of some people. And that's not \"black\", it's \"brown\".Gee, I guess pointing that out makes me the racist here.SUMO MATCHES ARE FIXED: Next we have a segment about Sumo wrestling corruption in Japan. Plus the exciting topic about Japanese police and their general incompetence. It's really a segment about religious corruption because Sumo is a sort of extension under the Shinto religion. This was a good segment, but a totally confusing mish-mash if you are not already familiar with Japanese culture - which this documentary assumes you are.ROE V. WADE DROPPED OUR CRIME RATES: These dummies claim Roe v. Wade and the whole abortion issue might just be the answer to lower crime rates. How's that? - you may well ask. Levitt did a study of the evil Romanian dictator Ceaucescu and his draconian you-have-to-have-a-baby-NOW laws from circa 1989. Levitt found that about 20 years later, Romanian crime had skyrocketed. Coincidence?Based on this interestingly weak observation, Levitt decided to study U.S. crime rates dating 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision. He claims he found crime had plummeted. Levitt asserts 50% of that total drop was thanks to Roe v. Wade and all the criminals-to-be that were never born. Allow me to explain why this is bad statistical use: Levitt freely asserts 50% of the drop in crime to be thanks to Roe v. Wade. He presents no evidence that he delved into ALL the necessary statistics to make that assertion.What is freely asserted is freely negated - any critics of my review familiar with THAT? If anyone expects me to quote statistical analysis here for the purpose of refuting these clowns, well, I don't have to do so. The burden is Levitt's. And he fails.BRIBE THE KIDS TO GET GOOD GRADES: For me this was the most stupid segment: an experiment in Chicago to bribe 9th graders to get good grades. The authors of the experiment believed bribes can and should be used to get these kids to do their schoolwork. As opposed to getting out on the street, joining a gang and possibly making several thousands of dollars a day doing whatever it is the gangs do.This type of film pains me. It is the usual pseudo-intellectualism camouflaged as something I can only label as 'significant trivia', and it has more to do with arrogant researchers who are full of themselves than it has to do with facts. Naturally, it deeply moves pseudo-intellectuals. This film tries to be light-hearted and humorous, but it falls flat.These \"experts\" are offensive idiots: they manage to insult the poor of all colors (is that funny?), the black community (oh, that MUST be funny), struggling parents (definitely not funny and most unwise) AND kids in dire need (just plain horrible and psycho). We can safely add that the authors/film narrators in some odd way have made pro-abortion people feel weird also.Imagine how they have offended cinema and the art of documentation.This certainly put me off reading the authors' book. Since I have a little bird who tells me things, I have had it brought to my attention that Levitt and Dubner \"read reviews\". Well, gentlemen, I hope you learned something from my review. The public has a right to know all balanced criticisms. Apparently, some strange enemy has read my review already anyway.Please know: my review is a great deal more fair than the documentary.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "These are serious subjects, not a clown show", "unixReviewTime": 1326412800, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B00459EZ7Q", "reviewerName": "Dennis A.

While others feel, similar to the \"Star Trek\" franchise, there are many stories that can still be told.From \"Stargate SG-1' to the animated series \"Stargate Infinity\" and then \"Stargate Atlantis\", here we are with the final season of \"Stargate Universe\", a series that met with fans who were split on whether they enjoyed or disliked the series.  Unfortunately, for this series which began in 2009, there was no renewal for a third season and thus the second season ended with a cliffhanger, just when the series had made some major changes and had gotten better.Should \"Stargate Universe\" had a chance to prove itself?  Afterall, even the popular syndicated series \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" had its haters and also didn't do well initially in the ratings, but given the chance to make the series better, it became one of the best \"Star Trek\" spinoff.  So, I ask the question again, did SG-U deserve to be cancelled?I'm sure that this will be a debate in which these split fans will continue to have varying opinions but the fact is, \"Stargate\" is over and in April 2011, \"Stargate\" producer announced that any plans for continuation of \"Stargate\" have been cancelled and that he had officially packed his desk.  17 years of \"Stargate\" on television and it looks as if this was the final nail on the popular military sci-fi franchise... Or is it?Nevertheless, I have been watching Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper's series and I admit that the first season was OK but the second season was even better.  I do dislike when a series never receives its full run and in this case, ending with a cliffhanger but still, the creators and the fans did all they can to keep the series going and one can hope that the story of \"Stargate Universe\" is completed in someway in the near future.  May it be through a film, animation or even a novel, one can only hold on to that hope.But for the fans who stuck with this series from beginning to end, here we are with \"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" featuring episode 21-40 on five DVD's and each DVD loaded with special features.  It's a great sendoff for the series and while it may not make up for a lack of closure, this set is an appropriate & special features loaded DVD set for the fans of the series!VIDEO & AUDIO:\"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and is presented in Englisy 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As expected with DVD, you're going to see a wee bit of compression, especially since there is a lot of data from the special features and audio commentary included on each disc.It is a shame though that the series that does feature a good amount of detail such as \"Stargate Universe\" will not get a Blu-ray release because this is one series that would look awesome in HD!Surprisingly, the PQ is good for DVD and it helps that there are some scenes that are shot outdoors and scenes with a lot of lighting.As for AQ, there are also some episodes that have a good amount of action and therefore you will hear scenes of explosions and laser blasts but once you get to the latter half of the season, this is where you hear the surround channels being utilized.  Dialogue is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:Robert Carlyle Directs - (4:16) Robert Carlyle (Dr. Nicholas Rush) directs the episode of \"Pathogen\".

In some ways, I am quite surprised that SyFy abandoned \"Stargate Universe\" since the network have been active in promoting the series for nearly two decades.  But a lot of networks known for a certain niche are starting to incorporate different programming and in the case of SyFy, Fridays which were typically Stargate night has been replaced by WWE Smackdown.Granted, it's all business and the fact was that \"Stargate Universe\" lost a lot of its viewers after the first premiere episode didn't help and to make things worse, episode after episode,  none were willing to come back and give it another chance for the second season.  It's unfortunate because the writers did make the adjustment and improved upon the first season.In fact, the talent seemed to gel, you can feel that everyone is much more comfortable playing the character, especially seeing the characters put into a variety of intense situations.  The character development of this series was much better this time around.  I bring up \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" as an example because the first season didn't do all that great and the characters weren't yet as comfortable until that second season and we see it with SG-U, the only difference is that ST:TNG was given a chance and it was also syndicated.It's sad because sci-fi TV series seem to have taken a back seat to vampire series and in the past, we would possibly have seen a network give SG-U a chance to prove itself but in this case, times have changed, business has changed and even the SyFy Channel has changed.So, the question is...who is this DVD for?For one, the fans of the series will surely pick it up as this is one jam-packed DVD with plenty of special features and audio commentary.  And I can only hope that those who were watching the first season, will pick this second and final season on DVD to see how this season did improve.But the fact is that the series ends with a cliffhanger and there is no sight of any conclusion coming any time soon.  But even as a cliffhanger, writing-wise, it was touching of how they utilized Eli's character and sets up things for hopefully something in the future.  May it be in  by novel, movie or something.  And I hope there is some closure for fans...hopefully something rather than nothing.I was hoping SyFy would have allowed the series to tie up some loose ends with a movie, afterall, \"Stargate\" has been part of SyFy for a nearly two decades, at least give those fans who did stick with the series some closure.  But I understand, at the end of the day, it's all business, afterall...Overall, \"Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\" was a much better season than the first and it was getting good.  The DVD is a wonderful set and a great sendoff for those who did take their time and stayed with the series from beginning through end and I also do recommend this series for those who stopped at the first season, I'm quite sure they will enjoy this second, final season much more, especially knowing that there is so much included on this DVD set.  Once again, fans will definitely want to pick this DVD Set up!Despite what the critics and hardcore fans of the franchise may have felt towards \"SG-U\", I give credit to the writers for making the much needed adjustments and making this final season worth watching and a final season DVD worth owning.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "(4.5 stars) A wonderful, jam packed DVD set for fans of the series & I enjoyed this second season much more than the first!", "unixReviewTime": 1307923200, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2011"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B004T9BAPC", "reviewerName": "Dennis A.

Victoria Justice talks about coming from Hollywood, Florida to Hollywood, California and having her own show.  Many more fun facts about the actress!Behind The Scenes - (:54) Behind-the-scenes of the cast of the \"Victorious\" two-episode special \"Locked Up\".A fun and entertaining series, the second season of \"Victorious\" has definitely improved since the first season and actress Victoria Justice continues to shine!When I saw Victoria Justice appearing on \"iCarly\" last year, I had the feeling that Nickelodeon or even Dan Schneider was planning to use the actress for a new show and I was right. Victoria Justice who had starred on \"Zoey 101' and had short roles in various Schneider-related series has her chance to not just showcase her acting but also singing.And here we are with \"Victorious\" season two.  The cast has since gotten better with their chemistry and Victoria Justice is much more confident playing the lead character and more comfortable in her performance this time around.The episodes are still fun, silly and enjoyable.  I do enjoy the way the writers integrate the characters in each episode and for the most part, the writing has gotten better.  For the majority of this season, \"Victorious\" focuses a lot on Victoria Justice taking on a variety of roles.  May it be a singer, a prom coordinator, writing her own play, making her own music, there was definitely a great utilization of the lead actress, while the supporting cast also have plenty of scenes as well.As for parents who are wondering if this is fine for children, for older children, I can say yes as there is no scenes that caused me to rethink of having my own son watching the series. But the series does focus on teenagers and it's a teen-driven comedy series. I didn't see any violence but kids who like to mimic what they say on TV, it's up to parent if they feel that the show is appropriate.There are some questionable scenes that parents may object to.  One features Cat Valentine accidentally receiving emergency calls on her cell phone and in her naive way, she loves the attention from the calls but doesn't really call 911 to get them help.  Another scene that parents may not want their children to watch is \"Tori Gets Struck\" which features Tori donating blood and when Robbie accidentally drops the bag, the blood explodes on both characters.  Definitely something that may freak out younger viewers.But I personally didn't find anything wrong with older children watching \"Victorious\" and they may enjoy the music especially the comedy presented in the series. For the most part, these episodes are safe and are intended for young teens or older children.And as for the series, this is not a musical show in the sense of shows like \"Glee\".  It's a different type of series that takes on teen issues, friendships and wacky situations.  The show is primarily about Tori Vega and while others may display their musical or acting chops, its a series about Tori and friends. No one breaks out in song or dance unless the situation calls for it but if anyone is doing any singing, it's Tori Vega and sometimes her very crazy sister Trina.I found the series to be fun and wacky at times. You have the teen drama, the teen angst and crazy moments, especially when it features ventriloquist Robbie Shapiro and his bad attitude dummy, the spaced out Cat Valentine or Tori's bratty older sister Trina.  I did notice that this second season featured less of Beck Oliver and shorter appearances by Tori's sister Trina and the episodes tend to focus on storylines that revolve around Tori, Andre, Jade, Robbie and Cat.As \"Victorious\" is on its third season, it's important to note that this is the complete second season of \"Victorious\" (whereas the first season was released in two DVD volumes).Overall, \"Victorious\" is a fun and enjoyable series and with the second season, the episodes continue its fun, crazy hijinks and good music. Victoria Justice has really developed to be a pretty solid actress with a solid voice.  So, I pretty much like how her character has been developed in these last two seasons.  Also, with the other characters itself, although I felt the writers are playing the naivety of Cat Valentine a bit too much and when there are no laughs but silence, it seems quite a bit awkward.  But the acting is much better for this second season, especially as the talent are now settled in.If you are a fan of \"Victorious\", this DVD of \"Victorious: The Complete Second Season\" is recommended!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Another season of enjoyable, fun and crazy episodes of \"Victorious\"!", "unixReviewTime": 1335571200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A2HVL790PBWYTU", "asin": "B004TPTY3G", "reviewerName": "H.

Cornered by zombie hordes, desperate to survive, the agents join forces with their enigmatic prisoner (Emilio Roso) who seems to be more in the loop about what the ef is going on with the walking dead.Later, the group crosses paths with a sniveling reporter and a berserker soldier (fresh out the nunnery) who spouts doomsday propaganda. Weird? Surreal? Creepy? Offputting? Yes. This crazed warrior would go on to say (with gusto) things like: \"Smells like the end of days.\"Oh, where to start, where to start? I'm tempted to give this a higher rating, only because I had ba11s of fun. But I won't. This is the first ever Serbian zombie movie, so congratulations, but it's crap. The production is so low budget I suspect my 6-year-old niece was the money behind it. The acting - I'm not sure if the English was dubbed for the Serbs or if the Serbian actors spoke their lines phonetically. Theirs is some of the worst delivery of dialogue I'd ever heard. The intonations, the inflections, are weird. The body language is off. But I don't want to cut slack on the other cast members who flaunts English as their native tongue. They're also ridiculous. The entire cast is so wooden no one had better light a match. My main reason for tuning in was to watch Ken Foree, who was so badass in Romero's seminal Dawn of the Dead (and maybe the best zombie film of all time). Here - and, given, it's some thirty years later - Foree seems comparatively subdued and worn down.The gorehound elements? Are weak. The zombie make-up is passable. But there's not much in the way of authentic scares. The zombie feastings are executed so cheesily. Neither are there memorable zombie kills. What's more, the zeds can't make up their minds whether they're slow shufflers or fast, hyperactive runners.The film isn't well served by its characters making moronic decisions (given, most are there to engorge the body count). Or by that horrid shaky cam.The positives? Yes, there are some, other than the happy accident of the film's sucking so hard, it gets good. Three good things. The Serbian setting is appropriately moody. I liked the nod to Assault on Precinct 13. The prisoner here is no Napoleon Wilson but he affects some of Napoleon's cool under pressure and shaky allegiance. The other neat thing is the meta-reference to Dawn of the Dead:- Jan the d0uche reporter: \"Wait, maybe we should find some shopping mall or something.\"- Agent Reyes: \"It'd be too hard to secure. And believe me, they would get in anyway.\"Best moment in the movie.Parting observations off the top of my head (and, I guess, a SPOILERS alert):- In the midst of fleeing the zeds, folks will insist on having meaningful discussions- snapping necks shouldn't kill zombies because the brain isn't affected (but it works in this movie)- Yes, absolutely, a desk with some chairs on it shoved against the door will keep out the zeds- Until a girl has a panic attack and starts dismantling that desk and chairs because, quote, \"I need to get out!\"- Lovin' the prisoner's dramatic but absolutely unnecessary midair leap while gunning down zeds (who are still blocked by that desk)- Living legend, ex-CIA, 20-years-in-the-field, Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes needs to work on his stance when holding a firearm. Also someone needs to teach him the proper technique for holding a gun and flashlight together.- When the group encounters a bunch of zombies lying prone on the ground (sunbathing?) in almost perfectly spaced order, Agent Reyes opts to walk thru them instead of, say, around them.- A professor decides to check if the area is finally clear of poison gas. How? By removing his gas mask.- So what happened to that girl who was abandoned at the dock by the creepy reporter? She gets saved by the prophecy warrior but then we don't see her anymore.- Stick around for a mid-credits scene to see what happens to the reporter. It's a lazy nod to the opening sequence of Lucio Fulci's classic Zombi 2 (1979).", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "The first ever Serbian zombie movie - and it's crap", "unixReviewTime": 1396915200, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1F93NA8HQ47IU", "asin": "B004YLCI74", "reviewerName": "Reconnecting To My Childhood \"Time Won't Let ...", "helpful": [40, 50], "reviewText": "\"South Park season 15 is... South Park. This March, South Park s***s in your eyes, ears and mouth. South Park, season frrrp, rated Arg for Pirates, f*** you!\"Oh, how many times will I head on down to South Park? Likely until the series ends. Still, these last two seasons have found my interests shift, not that I don't love the show and respect Matt and Trey as much as I always have, but priorities change and like Stan, I fear I'm getting old. There's something poetic about Stan only turning 10 and my having found this show when it started airing right as I turned 10. While I'll always follow this unique trailblazing show these last two seasons have found me picking up a lot of the episodes after initial airing due to life circumstances. Many times I forgot a new episode was on or that the new season had started. That said, when I found time to watch the episodes I enjoyed the majority of them.I will say this is a standout season from recent years. Many episodes this season follow the series' best of formulas, they aren't one-off episodes as much as they are a cumulative effort. A lot of quality ideas tossed together in a blender with some weirdness and some abstractness. You know what you have when you do that? You have yourself that classic South Park we all love. It's a shame not every episode can capture that old fresh charm the show once had but shows have to evolve and viewers change/desensitize. In the end this is a season worth owning for anyone who is still a fan or for those who possibly grew up on this more recent evolution of South Park. The purchase for those individuals is made even easier to justify given that they've included the insightful, and hilarious, documentary \"6 Days to air: The Making of South Park\". I actually think that is a highlight of this set along with the Getting Old/A$$ Burgers episodes.So what exactly are you getting yourself into with this season? Well, \"frrrp, dee derp frrrp\". But I'll break it down in a simpler fashion. 14 Uncensored (Yes Actually Uncensored this time) episodes:HUMANCENTiPADKyle doesn't know what he's signed himself up for when he agrees to iTUNES latest terms of service and user agreement. This episode perfectly mocks apple, social networking and the low budget horror film about a human centipede. Some people I know thought it missed the mark but I think they were unaware of the HC reference.FunnybotGermans create a robot that plans to take comedy to its logical extreme, global annihilation. Jimmy and Tyler Perry must save the day. To me the funniest part of the episode was Token being unable to keep a straight face at Tyler Perry. \"Oh Lor-awd!\"Royal PuddingMatt and Trey have always loved Terrence, Philip and the Canadians more than their general audience. So an entire episode about mocking the Royal Wedding with Canadian characters probably didn't sit well with most American viewers. As a Canadian I likely found it more enjoyable than I imagine they did, you know what I mean, eh there buddy-guy!T.M.I.When Cartmen believes the school has posted the boys wiener sizes he freaks and lands in anger management, soon after Randy joins him and they start a riot and the form a political party with demands for the government. A simple concept that I found enjoyable, the notion that all anger management is correlated with small manhood size may have some merit.Crack Baby Athletic AssociationKyle gets roped into Cartmen's new racket of helping crack babies by making them play basketball and raking in profits. I'm told, and it seems to be a commentary on the NCAA but I don't know enough about that to say anything meaningful. I know the episode all started from wanting to mock those commercials with the sad Sarah McLachlan song and I now know that Slash may or may not be real, but he is definitely a feeling in your heart.City SushiButters is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and the City Wok guy deals with new competition in town (and within himself). I found the idea of Butters being diagnosed MPD for playing pretend to be funny, then the idea that his therapist is the real sick person really topped it off nicely. I wonder, do younger fans appreciate the Psycho reference at the end as much as older ones? I liked it.You're Getting Old (1)Stand turns 10 and everything looks and sounds like crap to him. This episode, as mentioned, sparked a great deal of interest in the show again. Leaving off on a potential cliffhanger and actual serious moment like the show had never really seen. This episode will hit so close to home with many fans of the series, it sums up not just the majority of thoughts on the series itself, but a true aspect of growing up.Ass Burgers (2)Stan's negative attitude might be the result of a mild form of autism. Meanwhile Cartmen and Kyle start selling burgers of a special variety. This episode was hilarious. \"If there really were a social developmental disease you wouldn't call it ass burgers, that's, that's just mean\". Unfortunately for me this episode is funny and comes up with a resolution to the last episode that seems fitting but the continuing storyline will end here. The answer to all life's problems seems to be becoming an alcoholic.The Last of the MeheecansA game turns Butters into the last Meheecan (or Mexican). Cartmen becomes a boarder patrol guard as Butters travels to Mexico and a lot of the stupidity regarding the hysteria over illegal immigration is mocked.Bass to MouthA new gossip website is posting about the students at South Park elementary. The funniest thing here is that nobody cares until a post effects them and then they are all on board. Also nice to see Lemmiwinks return to take down his rival Wikileaks.Broadway Bro DownRandy learns the secret rewards of taking you wife to a musical and decides to write his own. A good episode that satirizes the Broadway scene, or 'Brod Way' in this case. All this is obviously on account of Matt and Trey's huge success with their own broadway hit, The Book of Mormon. It's fun to see the guys get to satirize something you know they've been wanting to.History Channel ThanksgivingA history channel documentary leads the boys astray in regards to Thanksgiving and Natalie Portman's wormhole must be opened. A nice satirizing of how pointless and speculative the supposed history channel has become and the movie Thor among other things. This was a good episode that is sure to become a Thanksgiving classic.1%Cartmen's screw ups in phys. ed wind up finding all the other students being punished for his failings. Then they all gang up against him. A relevant episode that satirized and mocked the whole OWS movement in a classic South Park fashion.Poor KidKenny's parents get taken away for shouting loudly and Cartmen doesn't know who to rip on for being poor anymore. Mysterion makes a welcome appearance and the concept of parents not being allowed to parent anymore is well explored. This was a well done finale for the season and if the giant reptilian bird at the end through some for a loop, think back to the agnostic foster parents speech.So there you have it. I think some people have stopped caring about the show as much after Comedy Central seemed to castrate it by foolishly censoring the 200&201 episodes last season, even on DVD/Blu-ray. I still and always will have a soft spot for this series. I may not keep up with the new episodes like I used to but it doesn't seem the show is going away just yet (3 more seasons) and I can always catch up on Blu-ray if I start missing the episodes altogether. I do hope that when the show does end Matt and Trey will find a way to give it a fitting end, obviously not a resolution exactly (there can't be one to a series like this) but something hilarious or shocking enough that it encapsulates the true spirit of the series. There would be no Animation Domination without this series. As much as people can say this series was possible only because of the Simpsons opening the door, none of the recent animated comedies would have been possible without South Park being the first ones to really push the boundaries, break down some more doors and punch some people in the face. This series truly founded adult oriented animated series'.I'll be buying this season because I loved the getting old episode and enjoyed most of the others in this batch. I always enjoy Matt and Trey's mini-commentaries. Then there is the great documentary I've already discussed which is included as a special feature along with behind the scenes of City Sushi and some deleted scenes. I felt slightly compelled by Stan and others getting old who see everything as crap to give this season only 4 stars. But in re-watching it before this review I have to say it is a marked improvement over other recent years with only the usual debatable misstep or two. The second half is especially solid.I opened with a rephrased quote from the season and another one seems to fit adequately in regards to my purchasing decision, lol:\"Is this season worth owning?

Far as I'm concerned, SUITS is the newest addictive show on television, and that's me not normally drawn to legal dramas. It's witty and funny and smart and loaded with that patented easy-breezy sense of fun that the USA network nowadays specializes in. The premise is irresistible, the cast is irrepressible. The two leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams, are so very good. I can't not rave.SUITS chronicles the exploits of the prestigious New York corporate law firm Pearson Hardman. More pointedly, the catchy premise revolves around sleek newly-made senior partner Harvey Specter (Macht) who dips into shady shenanigans when he takes under his wing a college dropout who was running away from the law when he happened to stumble across Harvey's office just when Harvey was in the middle of interviewing first year associates. Turns out, there's more to Mike Ross (Adams) than just being a slacker and a weed merchant. Mike boasts an eidetic memory. He reads something, he understands it. Once he understands it, he never forgets it. It's a neat party trick. It intrigues Harvey enough, impresses him enough, that he decides to gamble on Mike. And since Pearson Hardman only ever hires from a pool of Harvard law graduates, then begins the big fib of Mike Ross, Harvey's new associate and recent Harvard alumni.Mike Ross is a resourceful, idealistic cat (that whole weed thing was a one-time mistake). He makes for a terrific point-of-view character. As he navigates his way around his new environment, as he learns, we learn. Will Mike sink or swim in these shark-infested waters? That's part of the fun. In just about each episode, Mike is thrown a curve, is put in a situation in which he could get exposed. Sometimes, his quick thinking and his immaculate sense of recall get him out of predicament. Sometimes, Harvey, cool as the other side of the pillow, steps in. How long can these two keep up the charade? The show dares you to step away.Macht, gleam all wicked in his eye and so much hair gel the headrest of his Barcalounger is afraid, embodies Harvey Specter with supreme swagger, cocky and ruthless and unruffled. Once in a blue moon he exhibits his (begrudgingly) compassionate side. Harvey is touted as the firm's go-to closer, its most heralded gunslinger. In his competitive field, it's no surprise that his colleagues are resentful. And maybe none more envious than the always scheming junior partner Louis Litt (that fabulous gopher Rick Hoffman). Hoffman is great as the perennial burr in the saddle. He quickly makes Mike's time in the firm a partly sucky one. Mike becomes the human rope in Harvey and Louis' ongoing game of tug-of-war.Q: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer?A: His partners.Let me fragment sentence you: Predatory boardroom sharks, cooly preening and posturing and bedeviling clients with silver tongues, and yet graced with just enough of that bump of conscience to humanize them. I found myself suckered into that simmer between Mike and sexy, five-year paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle). I relish the hell out of Sarah Rafferty who plays Harvey's sassy secretary Donna, and we note Donna's understated pining for her boss. In fact, the interactions among the cast members are absorbing all around. Gina Torres as the firm's steely managing (and founding) partner is the icing on the cake. The cases handled by Harvey and Mike are watchable enough, and the legalese thrown at us is made decipherable enough. For those trying to become better people, morals and ethics are explored intelligently. Each time I side with Mike's naive nice guy perspective, Harvey extends a counter-argument which sheds a new light on the matter. My favorite moments are those in which Harvey sarcastically mentors Mike (with Mike frequently giving as good as he gets) and those moments in which Mike scrambles to maintain his Harvard cover. And I don't mind at all any scene in which the weasely Louis Litt gets what's coming to him. And let me reiterate: SUITS is FUNNY. I'm already 5 episodes deep into Season 2, and, if anything, I've gotten even more hooked. In Season 2, the stakes have shot up even more. As for Season One, get it. Get it now.The SUITS DVD set contains all twelve episodes of Season One and comes in three discs and with the following bonus stuff:- Pilot Extended Version- Audio Commentaries on 2 episodes: the pilot episode and the season finale \"Dogfight\" (both eps with exec. producer David Bartis, creator/co-exec. producer Aaron Korsh, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J.

A lot of the great stand-up comics are no longer with us, but Louis C.K. is not just one of the best alive; he's one of the best period. In 2010, FX gave Louis his own TV show and complete creative control over it. The show, a fictionalized version of his day-to-day life, was titled Louie and it's now one of television's most acclaimed shows. As a huge fan of his stand-up, I was a bit disappointed with the first season. I found it lacking something I couldn't quite put my finger on. I enjoyed the format immediately; the story interwoven with stand-up material. However, those first 13 episodes left something to be desired. Season 2 is an entirely different beast and ultimately a much better show; darker, more emotional, funnier, and each episode seems more thoroughly thought-out. Louis C.K. has found a consistency and rhythm as an actor, director, writer, producer, and editor and he seems more confident with the tone and direction of his show. This season is also much more story-focused, even with one episode centering almost entirely on masturbation.Watching the first season, I immediately noticed that Louie shares similarities with early Woody Allen films. It's a lazy comparison in many ways; both are comedians based in New York. Their humor is quite different, but there's a strong similarity in tone. The music, the New York setting, the dealings with human nature, etc. Allen's humor and dialogue is different from Louis', but the most substantial difference is simply that Allen's comedy is more refined and sophisticated. Watching this season I couldn't escape what a great idea it would be for Allen and C.K. to work together. Imagine my excitement at the recent announcement that he had joined the cast of Allen's upcoming film.Moving right along, Louie starts strong in the first scene of the first episode. Like the first season, the show is not preoccupied with a linear narrative thread. It has a loose structure that disregards continuity in favor of self-contained vignettes that stand on their own merit and can be admired individually. With each new episode you can see Louis' growth as a director and his evolving depth as a storyteller. There are poignant meditations on life and death, as well as some quietly hilarious and subtle moments such as an inspired scene with Louie in a subway watching a man beautifully play his violin as a homeless man disrobes behind him and begins showering himself with a water bottle. Several episodes portray Louie's fruitless pursuit of Pamela (played by actress Pamela Adlon) and the two share some nice chemistry. In one scene, Louie professes his love for her in an extended monologue that ranks as one of the most poignant moments of the entire series. His dealings with Pam are generally the most emotionally resonant passages of the show. There's an extended episode entitled Duckling that follows Louie on a USO tour and it may be the most accomplished episode in his repertoire.Two episodes that really stand out amongst the others are Oh Louie/Tickets and Eddie. The former begins with a rant against the poor quality of modern television, culminating in a face-off with Dane Cook (who plays himself). Many are familiar with the accusations that Cook lifted some of Louis' early material and the episode has the two engaging in a civil, well-written argument about this. The latter episode guest stars comedian Doug Stanhope and its cool seeing two of my favorite comics share the screen together. While Dane Cook essentially plays himself in his episode, Stanhope plays a broken-down comic named Eddie. Obviously, Stanhope and Eddie share similarities in their lifestyle and outlook but Stanhope brings an unexpected amount of pathos and depth to his role that is genuinely Emmy-worthy. Stanhope and C.K. have a strong dynamic together and it seems like there is a genuine friendship there. The entire episode is a triumph.There are many other celebrity guest appearances. One episode features a humble and self-aware Joan Rivers, with a majority of the episode consisting of dialogue between Rivers and C.K. We actually see Louis discovering his strengths as a writer, as this extended dialogue between the two is mesmerizing. Other guest appearances include Steven Wright, Chris Rock, and F. Murray (all appearing in the finale).Not every episode is perfect. While the first episode has a wonderful opening and is well-written and uplifting even, there's a long build-up to a joke that ends with flatulence. This joke is both lazy and unfunny, betraying the quality of what came before it. In the episode Country Drive, Louie takes his children to see their elderly Aunt Ellen. Much of the episode is filler (specifically in the driving scenes), but it contains a strong message and a particularly strong stand-up bit about the differences between Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.This brings me to the stand-up material. The stand-up bits rarely disappoint and there is some very strong material here. I respect Louis for not using sub-par material in favor of making sure all of his strong material makes it into a stand-up special. There are some gems here, one of my favorite bits being his description of a sexual encounter in the show's second episode. As a comedian, Louis C.K. has this brilliant ability to get right to the heart of a topic with such simplicity. This especially works in his favor in the television format. He recently released much of the material here as an audio special entitled WORD: Live at Carnegie Hall through his website, but even my familiarity with it didn't make it lose its edge.It's particularly impressive to note what a talented actor Louis C.K. is. As Louie he has established a likable, everyman persona that is a bit more sensitive and less confident than his stand-up persona. He plays a range of emotions in each episode, but the finale really puts his emotional range as an actor on full display. While it's hard to escape this scene's similarity to the conclusion of Woody Allen's Manhattan, it's a hilariously bittersweet ending that shows C.K. using some smart, subtle acting choices to convey his utter devastation.As a 20-year-old, I find it almost depressing how much I relate to C.K.'s material. That's what makes his stand-up and his show so wonderful. It connects with you on a level that only the best stand-up comedians are able to achieve; the material makes you laugh, it makes you think, and it makes you relate. Louis C.K. is a real auteur, handling all creative aspects of this show and making each episode on a shoestring budget. I think the lack of a cohesive narrative thread actually succeeds in making the show more interesting. With ease, it allows him to toy with emotions of the viewer and cover a broader range of subjects. I applaud Louis C.K. for this wonderful second season of his television opus, as well as FX for giving Louis the creative control that has made Louie one of the most unique, dynamic, and economical shows on television.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Brilliant Second Season of 'Louie'", "unixReviewTime": 1338940800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A2HVL790PBWYTU", "asin": "B005C4FD0Q", "reviewerName": "H.

Frequently our mere existence is jeopardized by these artifacts. Down thru the ages of man, a Warehouse has existed to store these objects, located in that era's most powerful nation, with especially-trained Warehouse agents called upon to collect and safeguard them. Today's version, the vast Warehouse 13, sprawls somewhere in the blasted nowhereness of South Dakota. And while Warehouse Agents Myka Berry and Pete Lattimer may sometimes come off as goofballs, they're exceptional at their job. Season 3 retains the lightness and goofy humor, but maybe it's so as to catch you wholly unprepared for the crushing Sturm und Drang of the closing episodes. This season tremendously hoists up the quality and pushes the actors and their characters to someplace they've not yet been.Myka's emotional departure in the Season 2 finale has left the rest of the Warehouse 13 staff seriously gutted. In Season 3's opener, \"The New Guy,\" time has elapsed, time enough that it's been decided to recruit a new Warehouse agent, except that everyone still misses the fudge out of Myka. But in comes the very likable ATF agent Steve Jinks (Aaron Ashmore) who happens to be a human lie detector. He rapidly becomes close to the Warehouse's resident geek tech support Claudia. And here's the cool thing about this episode: There's no teasing about. By the end of this episode Myka has come back to the fold. I didn't think her daytime gig of prim bookstore clerk was gonna fly for too long.The spotlight shines brighter on the Regents, specially since the season's projected big bad - as embodied by the dangerous Anthony Michael Hall - nurses an unrelenting vendetta against them and the Warehouse. Awesomely, Kate Mulgrew plays one of the Regents and her character presents an unexpected link to an Agent. Of course, the Regents forfeit that patina of intimidation and infallibility once Walter Sykes (Hall) starts abducting them, torturing them, eliminating them. And Sykes' end game is damn diabolical, as we learn in the finale. Jaime Murray wonderfully reprises her role as H.G. Wells. And, in what looks to be a steady poaching of Star Trek actors, Jeri Ryan guest stars in the hilarious episode \"Queen for a Day\" and Ren&eacute; Auberjonois also returns to impede Artie's fledgling romance. Speaking of which, I've got the back of any show that reintroduces my childhood crush Lindsay Wagner.Absolutely there are highlight episodes. Like \"3...2...1,\" which deepens the show's mythology. \"3...2...1\" features Warehouse teams from three different eras attempting to corral the fabled trumpet what blew down the walls of Jericho. This episode also marks the return of H.G. Wells, as well as of Rebecca St. Clair and Jack Secord, the two Warehouse agents/starcrossed lovers from the 1960s (from \"Burnout\" and \"Where and When\"). What we get are three interweaving threads from, respectively, 1893, 1962, and the present day. Jaime Murray is outstanding in those flashbacks to 1893, in which we see her unleash all manner of steampunk asskickery as a Warehouse 12 agent in the British Empire. Step back, Lara Croft. See this ep and wonder no more about why there's rumor of Jaime Murray getting her own Warehouse 13 spin-off series.\"Don't Hate the Player\" is the crossover with EUREKA as the Warehouse agents must save Fargo who is stuck in a virtual reality game. In \"Past Imperfect,\" Myka achieves closure when she gets a second crack at the man who murdered her former Secret Service partner. \"Insatiable\" is a fun story revolving around an artifact that turns people into zombies (except that Pete is somehow immune). And how does the taco truck figure into this? Meanwhile, \"Love Sick\" concerns Artie, Claudia, Dr. Vanessa Calder (Lindsay Wagner) and Hugo Miller (Auberjonois) trying to neutralize an artifact that transforms people into clay. But never mind that plot. This episode also finds Pete and Myka waking up in bed together, stark nekkid and stricken with amnesia.But it's the two-part finale - \"Emily Lake\" and \"Stand\" - that kicks the chair out from under. It ties up a lot of loose ends but then creates several cliffhangers. The writers pull no punches on this one. It's a hefty roster of casualties, and you won't like that some of them what don't survive happen to be popular characters. Let's face it, in this universe, there are so many ways to get your ticket punched (even including Horrible Death by Chess Match!). I like a show that caters to tongue-in-cheek stories but then recognizes when it's time to get dark and grim and pregnant with pathos. And I like that this cast of actors gets challenged in their performances. Awesome Allison Scagliotti, the most natural actor in the series, has a field day chewing scenery. She can channel some truly raw emotions. Still, I watch this show primarily for Myka and Pete's interactions. Joanna Kelly and Eddie McClintock have got their rapport and patter down pat, but this time they also get put thru their paces. And in light of the explosive finale, I can't wait to see where Season 4 takes us. Season 4, where, hopefully, deaths are not a permanent state, there's another EUREKA crossover in store, and Allison Scagliotti sings and plays her guitar some more.Okay, the Season 3 closer is actually the terrific Christmas episode, \"The Greatest Gift.\" The plot - Pete activates an artifact that erases his existence - makes use of one of them tantalizing \"What if?\" scenarios and serves as a nod to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

I fully understand that much of the show's content may be deemed offensive to some viewers, so to enjoy it, it's best to keep in mind that \"Archer\" is written in a satirical manner.  It is fair to warn, however, that the series earns its TV/MA rating quite well through use of crude language, violence, and sexual situations; basically, it's probably not suitable for children or anyone who isn't a fan of that sort of comedy.The storyline centers around Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin) who is the sort of spy Reed had imagined, only with a few extra character `flaws'--he is pretty much a sociopath.  Despite bearing the codename Duchess, Archer is considered the world's most dangerous spy; were he not absorbed with promiscuity, alcoholism, expensive toys and tactlenecks, he might also be considered the world's best spy.  Archer works for his self-centered and emotionally distant mother, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), at the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) based in New York City.  Fellow ISIS employees include agent Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), comptroller Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), agent Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), HR Director Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Head of Applied Research Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates), ISIS whipping-boy Brett Buckley (Neal Holman), and nut-job secretary Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer).  Other recurring cast-members include:  ODIN agent/cyborg/KGB leader Barry Dylan (Dave Willis), call-girl Trinette (Maggie Wheeler), ex-KGB head Nikolai Jakov (Peter Newman), ex-KGB agent/cyborg Katya Kazanova (Ona Grauer), and Archer's valet, Woodhouse (George Coe; Roy McCrery in flashbacks).Season 3 Guest Stars:  Italian Prime Minister Savio Mascalzoni (Luciano Palermi), manhunter and former ISIS agent Rip Riley (Patrick Warburton), Cuban drug lord Rom&aacute;n Calzado (Joaquim de Almeida), slave pirate Noah (David Cross), Canadian terrorist Kenny Bilko (Robb Wells)**, NYPD Detective Murphy (Lloyd Sherr), Sheriff E.Z. Ponder (Michael Rooker), Pangu pirate Bucky (James Hong), train manager George (Dave Fennoy), Commander Kellogg (Dave Fennoy), Yakuza boss Mr. Moto (George Takei), ISA researcher Trish (Brett Butler), Randy Gillette (Jack McBrayer), Jenette Gillette (Paula Malcomson), Commander Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), and film-star Burt Reynolds.ARCHER:  THE COMPLETE SEASON THREE--kicked off in January of 2012.  The third season carries some of the long-running jokes from Seasons One and Two; but the third season begins to provide more plot-depth.  Some of the continuing themes include:  Who is Archer's father?  Will Brett finally die?  What is Barry's master plan?  Will Lana and Archer get back together?  What is to become of the rivalry between Barry and Archer?  Will Archer and Pam continue their relationship?  How does Barry get home?SPECIAL FEATURES:  [13 Episodes/2 Discs]  `Heart of Archness' Trilogy Enhanced, Book-on-Tape Fail, Cooking with Archer, Gator 2--Trailer, \"Archer\" Season 3 as Comin-Con 2012, and Commentaries on `El Contador,' `Drift Problem,' and `Lo Scandalo.'EPISODES:Episode 1:  \"Heart of Archness:  Part I\"--In the wake of Katya's death, archer has been missing for three months.  Even though ISIS has been reporting better numbers in his absence, Malory determines it's time to bring Sterling home.  She hires Rip Riley, manhunter and former ISIS agent, who has tracked Archer to a small island in French Polynesia where he has been tending bar and ruining honeymoons.  Rip forces Archer onto his sea plane, Lucy Goosey; Archer manages to incapacitate Riley and commandeer the plan, but his lack of understand on the concept of autopilot causes Lucy to run out of fuel and crash into the Pacific.  Following the crash, Archer selflessly chooses to save Rip over a bottle of booze.  After losing contact with Riley, Malory spares no expense sending Lana and Ray to rescue Archer.  As it turns out, a gang of pirates kidnaps Riley and Archer with the intention to ransom; Archer, with the help of his Omicron Spymaster, quickly relieves the head pirate of his duties, thus making himself the new Pirate King of the pirate island, Pangu.Episode 2:  \"Heart of Archness:  Part II\"-- To begin his reign as Pirate King, Archer imprisons Riley.  Noah (David Cross) is one of the slave pirates; he was an anthropology doctoral candidate working on his dissertation when he was captured.  Because he speaks English, Archer uses Noah as a translator for communicating with his subjects.  Archer is living-it-up as Pirate King, but neglects his duties as a pirate, leading to low morale among the men; Bucky attempts to overthrow Archer by melawan raja.  Rip escapes his dungeon and contacts Malory by radio.  Amid the skirmish, the pirates mutiny; Sterling, Rip, and Noah end up in the dungeon.  When Ray and Lana arrive on the shore of Pangu, they are quickly captured and thrown in the cell with the others.  Back at ISIS, Cyril is both drunk and concerned for the impact Archer's rescue will have on the budget; he does some blackout online banking... and Pam.Episode 3:  \"Heart of Archness:  Part III\"--Cyril realizes he embezzled all of ISIS's funds during the late-night banking session, but can't remember the password he used.  Pam suggests they try drunken-recall; the two repeat their actions from the previous night.  Ray and Lana are shot during a struggle between Archer and Bucky.  In order to save Ray from succumbing to blood loss, the team has to make a quick escape... meaning there isn't time for Noah to retrieve his dissertation before fleeing.  Because the rest of the pirates are distracted by the intramural lacrosse final, Archer, Lana, Ray, Riley, and Noah manage to make a (mostly) clean getaway.Episode 4:  \"The Man from Jupiter\"--Archer finally meets his hero, Burt Reynolds, only to discover that Burt is dating his mother.  Archer disregards the threat of a Cuban hit-squad trying to kill him and focuses on kidnapping Burt to keep him away from Malory.  The Cubans mistake a wheelchair-bound Ray for Sterling and pursue Lana, Ray, Krieger, and Cyril (and Krieger's virtual ex-fianc&eacute;) in Dr. Kriger's newly handicap-accessible conversion van.  Burt and Archer join the car chase to take out the Cuban hit-squad and save Lana.Episode 5:  \"El Contador\"--Since Ray is paralyzed, Malory promotes Cyril to field agent.  Malory sends Lana, Archer, and Cyril to bounty hunt the notorious Cuban drug lord and distributor for La Sombre, Rom&aacute;n Calzado.  Lana and Archer lose Cyril while trekking the South American jungle; after their capture, Archer and Lana discover Cyril back at Calzado's compound, passing himself off as `El Contador' (Spanish for \"the accountant\") for La Sombre.  Cyril visits Lana and Archer in their cell to warn them that, come morning, he and Calzado will be hunting them, `the most dangerous game.'  While he is clearly not cut out for the physically-oriented spy work, Cyril proves his tactical worth in the field.  Back at ISIS:  Ray, Cheryl, and Pam are sent into full panic-mode when Malory announces an ISIS-wide drug test.  Dr. Krieger seizes the opportunity to promote and test `Krieger-Cleanse,' a tea formulated to remove all traces of drug use from the body.  After ingesting the disgusting tea, Ray, Pam, and Cheryl experience terrifying hallucinations.Episode 6:  \"The Limited\"-- **Special Guest Stars of this episode are Robb Wells, John Paul Tremblay, and Mike Smith, who respectively play Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles on the Canadian show \"Trailer Park Boys.\"**  The ISIS team is in charge of extraditing Canadian terrorist Kenny Bilko, of the New Scotland Front, back to Ottawa.  Because they are traveling on the Tunts' railroad, Cheryl has her personal train cars hooked up, allowing Ray, Cheryl, Pam, and Babou to tag along for the mission.  Malory treats the train manager, George, as her personal slave--furthering the stereotype that Americans are racist.  Once they hit the Canadian border, Lana and Archer are met with two teams of Canadian Mounties, one of which is an imposter group attempting to free Bilko.  When Cyril loses him grasp on Bilko, Archer (with the help of Babou) finally gets to fulfill his dream of fighting an enemy atop a moving train.Episode 7:  \"Drift Problem\"--For Sterling's birthday, Malory gives him a brand new Krieger/Dodge Challenger Special-Edition Spycar (thanks Dodge).  Much like the Schwinn Stingray bicycle he received in childhood, Malory makes the gift conditional:  if Sterling doesn't take the utmost care of his new toy, there will never be another.  When the Challenger is stolen from his garage, Archer scrambles to recover it before Malory finds out.  Pam, who has been moonlighting as a drift-car racer, suggests that the Yakuza may be responsible for the theft.  The ISIS team embarks on a repo mission in the drift-car underworld; Archer disrespects the Yakuza boss, Mr. Moto, which leads to a guns-blazing car chase.  Malory shows up to both dispose of Mr. Moto and lecture Sterling on responsibility.  The final scene shows the Challenger with its new owner, Mr. Ford, a character from \"Frisky Dingo.\"Episode 8:  \"Lo Scandalo\"--The opening scene shows Malory, alone in the dark, with gun in-hand.  Archer and Lana are called to her apartment only to discover a man in a latex zentai and bound to a seatless chair; he is dead with five bullet wounds to the chest.  The corpse is Italian Prime Minister Savio Mascalzoni.  Malory reveals that she has been engaging in an annual affair with Mascalzoni since they met on Operation Gladio during WWII.  For fear that Malory is being framed for murder, Dr. Krieger arrives to take command of the scene; he invites Cheryl, Ray, Pam, and Cyril along to each carry out pieces of the disseminated body.  When NYPD Detective Murphy investigates a mysterious tip about a murder in Malory's apartment, the gang attempts to be nonchalant by staging a `fancy' dinner party.Episode 9:  \"Bloody Ferlin\"--Lana and Archer discover Ray in the ISIS armory, and that he isn't really paralyzed.  Ray is planning to return to Ferlin, West Virginia, to help his brother, Randy, in a battle against the town sheriff, E.Z. Ponder, who Ray believes is trying to take Randy's dope farm for himself.  Archer and Ray bring Cheryl along to pose as Ray's wife.  Randy and his wife, Jenette, have a progressive `open-marriage;' they agree that if Randy gets to sleep with Ray's wife, then Jenette can sleep with Archer.  While back in the Holler, Ray gains a new perspective on family... and reconciles his adolescent feud with E.Z. Ponder.Episode 10:  \"Crossing Over\"--Archer awakens to a killer hangover and no memory of what happened.  Following his steps from the previous night, Archer learns that he had the best sex of his life with [drumroll] Pam, but mandates she not tell anyone.  At ISIS, Malory reveals that Nikolai Jakov wants to defect--a problem for Malory because she thinks she's still dating Burt Reynolds.  Nikolai is pushed out of Moscow by the new KGB leader, Barry, who apparently has some huge and mysterious master plan for the KGB; Jakov's former assistant, Boris, helps him flee to the U.S. where he is kept in the ISIS safehouse.  While in charge of babysitting Jakov, Archer begins to bond with his could-be father.  When Barry learns of Jakov's defection, he tracks Nikolai to the safehouse and assassinates him, eliminating any chance for Archer to gain closure on his paternity.Episode 11:  \"Skin Game\"--Dr. Krieger has a surprise for Sterling:  he has rebuilt Katya as a cyborg.  Archer and Katya pick back up in their relationship, with only minor weirdness at the fact that she is now a robot.  Archer convinces his mother to make Katya an ISIS agent; the decision is made mostly on the grounds that ISIS will need their own cyborg if they are to defeat Barry.  Archer and Katya plan to wed as soon as possible, but attract a certain objector:  Barry.  When Archer and Barry begin to fight, Katya steps in to create an all-out cyborg-v.-cyborg death match.  In order to drain their voltaic cells, Krieger cuts the power; when the lights come back on, Archer discovers that his fianc&eacute; and arch-nemesis are doing more than dancing.Episode 12:  \"Space Race:  Part I\"--Commander Kellogg of the space station Horizon may-days Commander Anthony Drake of the ISA to warn that a space-pirate mutiny has occurred.  Drake explains to the ISIS team that with the continuous increase in Earth's population, space is the `new horizon;' he enlists the ISIS agents to travel into space aboard the Intrepid so that they may assist in restoring order on Horizon.  Lana, Cyril, Archer, and Ray get about a day of space-camp training--which exposes Lana's weak stomach for zero gravity, but Drake mandates she go anyway.  Once in space, Pam and Cheryl are found as stowaways aboard the Intrepid; seeing as how they're women, Drake doesn't seem to mind, but locks Archer up for allowing them onboard.  Archer convinces Pam to release him from his cell so he can join the battle of the \"boarding-party space-pirates.\"  After Drake uses the ISIS agents to defeat the \"mutineers\" and regain control of Horizon, Commanders Drake and Kellogg reveal themselves as the true mutineers; they have kidnapped the research crew (referred to as `involuntary laborers') and intend to use them as breeding-stock for populating Mars.  Due to Lana's superior genetics and IQ, she is destined to be the Martian Queen.Episode 13:  \"Space Race:  Part II\"--Much like a scene from \"Star Wars Episode IV,\" Archer, Lana, Ray, and Cyril are forced into a sealed room by `Stormtroopers' Drake and Kellogg; Lana's physique and Archer's locker-room experience secure their escape.  Back on the Intrepid, Pam begins to make trouble for the mutineers.  Lana and Archer find the imprisoned `involuntary breeding-stock;' Trish, one of the ISA scientists, explains that the only way to get back to Earth is on the Intrepid--which can only be piloted by either Drake or Kellogg.  Cheryl regales Drake with her desires to become Martian Queen, granting Pam the chance to subdue him.  In a standoff, Kellogg surrenders, but Cyril shoots him (and everyone else) anyway.  Meanwhile, Barry (dressed to resemble Luke Skywaler) is on his way to Horizon so that he may continue torturing Archer.  Archer is very excited to play with Barry--who even promises to let Archer wear the space-bot suit; even though it kills Archer to do so, he has to take a rain check on the play date.  Since they don't have a captain, Cyril volunteers to pilot the Intrepid for the return flight.  During liftoff from Horizon, Cyril destroys Barry's ship... leaving Barry trapped in space.  The Intrepid crash-lands on earth, leaving the ISIS crew with fairly minor injuries (excluding Ray, of course, who is paralyzed for real this time).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Archer:  The Complete Season Three", "unixReviewTime": 1382400000, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A1UB6Z3RO4TQYW", "asin": "B006Y5BWQG", "reviewerName": "buho_blanco", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "First of all, if you are a rather conservative person and/or can't stand to see two men kissing each other (A LOT), then you will want to avoid this show. I'm straight, but I'm fairly liberal, and lived most of my life in California, not all that far from San Francisco. I've had many gay, lesbian, and bisexual friends and co-workers, so I'm somewhat used to this.Why so many gay characters in one show? Simple - it's about Broadway. It's about musical theater, which involves a lot of dancing. It's common knowledge that lots of men involved in Broadway and professional dance are gay. This show strives to be honest and realistic, as far as I can tell, and having lots of gay men in the show is realistic.Ok.. moving on.So, why did I, a straight dude who isn't overly fond of Broadway musicals, watch this show?I needed some variety. My favorite shows are \"Community,\" \"The Wire,\" \"Person of Interest,\" and \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"  Three of those four shows have at least some violence in them, and some suspense as well. Also, I've watched all the episodes of \"Community\" over and over again MANY times. I needed something different from what I've been watching. \"Smash\" is certainly different.Another reason I watched both seasons of this program is that I am very much interested in the creative process, and creative people. I like shows, movies, and documentaries about creative people, such as writers, actors, filmmakers, musicians..And lastly, I wondered how a Broadway show would start out, how it got put together, how a musical went from script and score to the stage, what it would be like to be a writer, director, producer, actor, etc. This show presents all those things, which I think is really great. The behind the scenes people get as much screen time as those who take the stage night after night.The show starts out with a man and woman who are creative partners. The man writes the music and the woman writes the script/story. They are sitting around trying to come up with a new musical. They've been working together for ten years, and have already had several hits. They want to continue their winning streak. An idea for a musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe comes from an unlikely source, and they go with that idea.The two then team up with a producer and a director, and put a cast together. Surprisingly, very few auditions are shown, which I found slightly disappointing at first, but then thought that hey.. we get loads of auditions in shows like \"American Idol,\" so we don't need all that here on \"Smash.\"There are two women who are competing for the role of Marilyn, and seem equally great to the various people in charge of making decisions for the musical. Some of the show is about the rivalry between these two women. Both actresses have their supporters and detractors.I'd say half the show is dedicated to getting the musical up and running, and the rest is about the personal lives of the various characters. Show business of any kind can wreak havoc on relationships. Also, creative people often tend to be neurotic. None of the personal lives of any of the characters goes really smooth.The cast and the acting..Megan Hilty plays Ivy Lynn, one of the two actresses vying to play Monroe. Ivy has been in the business for many years, but keeps getting stuck in the chorus (also called the ensemble, as far as I can tell). She's never had a big break. Ivy is a VERY sexy, devious and ambitious blonde. Hilty plays this character perfectly, and has a fantastic voice and stage presence.Kathrine McPhee plays Karen Cartwright. Karen is a sweet, too-skinny brunette who is practically a saint. She's too nice to be all that interesting. She's my least favorite character on the show. Also, McPhee, unlike Hilty, does not have a Broadway background. McPhee has a much more pop-sounding voice. She was an American Idol contender some years ago. She got to second place, if I remember correctly.I know McPhee can play a sexy and sneaky character. She played just such a character in an episode of \"Community,\" and was very good. It's not her fault her character is too nice.Debra Messing plays Julia, the \"book\" writer.. who writes the story and script for the musical. Julia is straight, but not exactly cut out for monogamy. She is confident at times, but at other times, practically falling apart. Messing plays this character well, and is rather attractive. I think she is great in this role. I've never watched an episode of \"Will & Grace,\" so this is the first show in which I've seen Messing.Julia's creative partner, Tom, played by Christian Borle, is gay, a little more psychologically stable than Julia, and funny. He writes the music. Tom gets some of the best lines in the show. He is very good friends with Ivy. Factions eventually develop.. some people are in favor of Ivy getting the lead role, some want Karen to get it, others are on the fence for most of the show.Derek, the director, is played by British actor Jack Davenport. He's a tyrannical, womanizing guy who just has to try and bed any woman who has the potential to be a lead actress, and some women who are not. He occasionally has moments of kindness, and is witty. He's got that great, dry British style of humor. He doesn't much like working with gay men, and this creates both tension and amusement. Derek and Tom, for example, really don't like each other, and both are good with creative insults.The last person in the cast I shall mention is Eileen. She is the producer of the musical, and is played by Anjelica Huston. You probably have already seen Huston in one or more films, and know she's a talented actress. I'm a fan of Huston because she's been in several Wes Anderson movies, and I tend to love Wes Anderson movies (though not all of them).Huston's character, Eileen, is a very tough, driven, but not mean woman. Eileen is a very likeable character. She is going through a divorce with her philandering husband. She and her husband had always worked together as a team. The Monroe musical is the first one Eileen is attempting to produce without her husband.Overall, the acting, by practically everyone, is, as the British say, spot on.So.. why 4 stars instead of 5?Two reasons. The first reason is, in neither in the first, nor the second season, do we get to see the whole musical. I think there should have been one episode entirely dedicated to just showing the musical. We see tons of work put into it, and we do get to see some numbers, but we never get to see the finished product. I found this to be very frustrating.Another thing I didn't like.. some of the songs just aren't good. There are not only Broadway-style songs in the show, but pop songs as well. Some of the pop songs are covers, and some are originals, I'm guessing. I actually liked most of the songs for the musical though.The last reason I am deducting one star is that I just can't see Karen as being strong competition for Ivy. Ivy looks quite a bit like Monroe, regardless of what she is wearing. Also, Ivy has the Broadway voice. Karen, when dressed as Marilyn, looks freakish to me. And, Karen has a pop-singer voice. To me, the blatantly obvious choice for Marilyn is Ivy. I will not tell you who ends up with the lead role.Although this show is not perfect, it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, in my opinion the second season is not as good. Still worth watching, but definitely not as good as the first season. I won't get into the reasons why in this review.Thanks for reading.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very interesting, rather entertaining, slightly flawed.", "unixReviewTime": 1400976000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO", "asin": "B007PYEWZ8", "reviewerName": "Robert Badgley", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Meeting Evil(released May/12)stars Samuel L. Jackson as Richie,Luke Wilson as John Felton and others,in this surprisingly enjoyable but tense thriller/drama about a man on the edge,who ignores the warning signs when a psychotic killer comes a calling.John Felton is a real estate agent who lives in a subdivision which has got more empty houses due to bankruptcy and foreclosures,than folks occupying them.He comes home,on his birthday,after losing his job and is contemplating his future when there is a knock on the door.Standing there is Richie,a black man,intense in nature,with a fedora,who says his car stalled in front of his house.He asks John for a push and he obliges him.After a few feet the car starts but as it does it stops suddenly,hurting Johns leg.Ritchie offers him a ride to the hospital and he reluctantly goes,despite his uneasy feeling about the man.Along the way John gets ever the more reluctant about Ritchie.They stop for gas where a young attendant gets on the wrong side of Ritchie.While John stays in the car Ritchie goes into the 7-11 style premises and John can see some kind of kerfuffle inside.Just then Ritchie reappears saying the gas was free,and they leave.Instead of going to the hospital they end up at a bar.John had forgotten his wallet,so he goes to a place that sells phones.The lady there is really rude and he leaves.He tries to use the phone inside the bar but has no money.He finds an old girlfriend inside who ultimately offers him and Ritchie a ride home.Before they leave Ritchie has paid a visit to the rude woman in the phone store and has returned verifying her attitude to John.Ritchie guides them to the impound(his car had been towed in front of the bar),but time passes and they are getting farther and farther to nowhere.By this time Ritchie has become much stranger in his behaviour.A trucker suddenly comes up and runs the car off the road,and the driver confronts John.He tells John he murdered his girlfriend(the unfriendly phone woman).Unnoticed by the trucker,Ritchie gets in Johns girlfriend's car and runs the driver over,and they leave.They find a farm driveway soon after and they drive into it.It is apparent Ritchie knows the place,but John finds a phone and is able to get part of his call out to the police about the incident on the highway,before he is cut off.By now John and his girlfriend know this man is just not right in the head and are very uneasy about their safety.Ritchie confines both to the farm,when a cop drives up.While Ritchie kills the cop,the two escape and head out through cornfields and part ways.John walks for a long time until he finally reaches a roadway and a cop car finally arrives.He drops to his knees,only to find the cop is Ritchie in disguise.Ritchie makes John put on the troopers hat and while Ritchie slumps in the back seat,John drives right through a police barricade.Once past Ritchie lets John out and he runs for freedom.He reaches a busy highway and starts stopping cars for help.A police car finally arrives and arrests him for the number of murders they think he has committed.John explains about Ritchie but they do not believe him.Eventually his girl friend shows up in police custody and she verifies his story.John is let free and his wife is there to meet him at the police station.Back home the two are settling back in when there is a knock at the door.Unbeknownst to his wife,who answers,it is Ritchie in disguise as a cop.He comes in and they start chatting.Not too far along she starts getting suspicious about him because of his off hand remarks.When John comes into the living room the cat is out of the proverbial bag.Ritchie explains that his wife has been unfaithful to him by having relations with the pool man;the very reason he came in the first place.Coincidentally(or not),at the beginning of the film when John arrived home,he was greeted by the pool man walking out his driveway.John holds his wife at knife point,at Ritchie's urgings,and when Ritchie approaches John,John stabs him instead.A fight ensues which ends up in a mud hole in the backyard,filled with rain water.The police arrive,and at the critical moment they shoot Ritchie dead.The film ends as John and his wife sit in bed,with the wife asking whether everything will be alright.There is no answer.This film makes one think of what one would do in John's shoes,i.e.would we ignore the warning signs?It makes one identify easier with John as he gets sucked down ever more into Ritchie's quagmire.Jackson plays Ritchie beautifully.He has this maniacal look and attitude,but is always just sitting on the edge.He doesn't go over the edge at John,whom for some reason he\"likes\",but takes things out on others like the lady who offended John at the phone place,or the customers and employees of the 7-11 style gas store.You wait for Ritchie to lose it on John,but it never happens.But that also keeps the tension high at all times.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp.There are,unfortunately,no extras.All in all a nice,taut thriller which has Samuel Jackson on top of his game playing an intense,psychotic killer type,who stalks Wilson,who is at his wits end in his life.Wilson learns alot about himself and his life through it all.4 solid stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A surprisingly good thriller!", "unixReviewTime":

I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not-so-subtle inferences and implications of my indignity, THAT I don't care about.The review:1) Aang's epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord. There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc. Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal. Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko's hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant. This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine, but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that, other than providing latent back story, have no place in Korra's story. The problem is, the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original, and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale. That was spread out ham-handedly over most of the show. It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcass. If you don't like that analogy, pick your own to suit.4) Aang earned his powers. He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent, if basic, versions of the bending techniques, but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions. Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending. There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse. Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies, not adventure tales. If Korra is not learning, then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development, nor that of the story line. In fact, because she is so powerful, it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she can't learn what she wants exactly when she wants. Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No, Korra's story did not need to follow Aang's exactly, but she should not just have everything handed to her. If she had been a fourth generation decedent, that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next...5) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators. Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles. Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds. Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls, and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mass-transit system for people and cargo. In fact, there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it's innermost source in bending. There is a reason why we have the expression, \"necessity is the mother of invention\". If you do not need the improvement, it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden, Korra goes to Aang's science city and finds microphones, televisions, cars, printing presses, guns, and all the other conveniences of modern society. Did everyone forget that Aang, Katara, and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires, bed rolls, and fish they had caught from a stream, as well as protect themselves with swords, boomerangs, and staves?Korra is not that old, and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died. This means that the society's evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime. This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between. Bending cannot account for that, especially when this society seems decidedly anti-bending. If the civilizations that came before Aang, all of which had bending powers, had not come up with this super society, how now brown cow? There were-what, 500 or so Avatars before Aang? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about? It makes no sense.6) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode, but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point, a sort of conspiracy theorist's coffee table distraction if you will. How do you make such a crap-tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews? Well, corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire \"Facebook Developers\" to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand \"likes\" to their brands to increase faith in their products. To me, it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra, Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous. If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion, it is merely that. I don't care if it is true or not. I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice:Think for yourself. Watch the episode with an open mind like I did. If you think it's the best thing you ever saw, \"like\" it on facebook! If you think it sucked like I did, be careful should you place a review that states this. You may just be painting a target on your back, again, like I did. Don't let people TELL you what to like, when to laugh, or to accept their hackneyed writing pell-mell.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't reply to this review", "unixReviewTime": 1336694400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B0082CXI34", "reviewerName": "Dennis A.

Cartoons\" and \"The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack\" and most recently \"Bravest Warriors\", but in 2010, Ward would create a series that would become a popular animated series on the Cartoon Network titled \"Adventure Time\".Originally produced by Frederator's Nicktoons Network animation incubator series \"Random! Cartoons\", the short for \"Adventure Time\" would first become a viral hit on the Internet before being picked up by the Cartoon Network and featured on television in 2010.Heavily inspired by \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and video games, \"Adventure Time\" is hand-drawn animation and is recorded as a group, than with voice talent recorded individually.With a sixth season of \"Adventure Time\" to air in 2013, since 2012, the series has earned around 3 million viewers per week and has led to video games and comic books based on the animated series.And now \"Adventure Time\" (Season one and two) will be released individually on Blu-ray in June 2013.\"Adventure Time\" is a series that revolves around Finn the Human, a 14-year-old boy and his best friend, a talking yellow dog named Jake, who has magical powers to change shape, stretch and shrink.The two live in a post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo where they interact with friends such as Princess Bubblegum, the Ice King, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Lady Rainicorn and more!Season 2 features a total of 26 episodes which are 12 minutes long (all episodes are on one Blu-ray disc).

The animation is absolutely fantastic in HD! Colors are vibrant, color palette is colorful and while the character designs may lack incredible detail and shading of other animated series (note: background art is shaded), what makes \"Adventure Time\" work is its abundance of characters, creative backgrounds, locations and more.During my viewing of the series, I did not see any artifacts, banding, even during scenes with a lot of red or orange. Line detail is very strong and for the most part, fans of the series should be happy with the overall presentation.AUDIO:\"Adventure Time - The Complete Second Season\" is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0. While my picky side would prefer for a 5.1 immersive soundtrack, the fact is that a lot of animated series is presented in stereo. Dialogue is clear!Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES\"Adventure Time - The Complete Second Season\" comes with the following special features:The Crew of Adventure Time Interviewed by Pendleton Ward - (6:16) A short featurette as Pendleton Ward interviews those responsible for season two of \"Adventure Time\".Audio Commentary - (5:06:03) All episodes of season two have audio commentary.  So, you get over five hours worth of audio commentary. Please note that if you want to listen to audio commentary by episode, it's best to select \"Episodes\" and you can select regular audio or with commentary, otherwise if you click on special features and audio, it's \"play all\". You do get a message from Pendleton War about the state of the audio commentary and because it was written at his home, during audio dips, he would interject some music.EXTRAS:\"Adventure Time - The Complete First Season: An Amazing Adventure\" comes with a slipcover.  Also, included is an Ultraviolet code which allows you to watch and share on computers, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, game consoels and connected TV's.JUDGMENT CALL:Finn and Jake's adventures continue with season 2 of \"Adventure Time\".Some wonder if Pendleton Ward and staff can continue to make the series better with each new season and for season two, the crew managed to come up with fun and crazy episodes but also bringing in some star guest talent such as Biz Markie, Paul Reubens, Henry Rollins, Laura Silverman, Andy Samberg and more!There a great number of episodes in season two that are absolutely hilarious!  One includes \"Blood Under the Skin\" which involves Finn and Jake trying to find the Magical Armor of Zelderon but let's just say that they managed to come up with a ball game, that I hope people never duplicate (but somehow I get a feel frats may be inspired by this series).  You have the Ice King shaving his beard and trying to be the \"Nice King\"; Finn needing Princess Bubblegum's hair to save Jake from a balding Tree Witch, Jake having to meet Lady Rainicorn's parents, Finn having a musical duel with Death in \"Death in Bloom\" to Marceline pulling yet another prank on the gullible two and making them think they are vampires.There are plenty of awesome episodes in \"Adventure Time - The Complete Second Season\". It's important to note that anyone can jump in with season two without having previous knowledge of the series (as each episode are standalone).  The series is pretty much an episode of adventures featuring Finn and Jake and what happens when the come across a variety of characters. Some crazy, some goofy, some evil and more!Part of the enjoyment I had while watching this series is the fact that it's not banal. You can't predict what will happen with each episode as it is not formulaic, crazy things happen and just to see how each character deals with a certain situation, you can't help but laugh and be entertained.As for the Blu-ray release of \"Adventure Time - The Complete Second Season\", the series looks incredible on Blu-ray. Colors are absolutely vibrant in HD. While it would have been nice to have a 5.1 lossless soundtrack instead of a Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack, it does happen with many animated series.While the first season had featurettes and animatics, \"Adventure Time - The Complete Second Season\" does have a single featurette featuring the crew that making \"Adventure Time\" possible (for season two) but surprisingly, all episodes have audio commentary!  The first season had a total of eight (audio commentary from cast and animatics commentary), so I was pretty pleased that all episodes had commentary tracks.  And like the series, the audio commentaries are ful of humor and also pretty cool information about each episode.Overall, if you are a fan of \"Adventure Time\", I can easily say that you're getting your money's worth with both Blu-ray releases of \"Adventure Time\".  But if you purchased the first season, the second season is a no-brainer!  It's a must own!If you are looking for an animated series that is crazy, hilarious, addictive and so much fun, \"Adventure Time\" is highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "(4.5 Stars) With \"Adventure Time - The Complete Second Season\", you get 26-episodes, 26 audio commentaries.

"360(released July/12) stars Sir Anthony Hopkins,Jude Law,Rachel Weisz and many others.It's a well done filmic study in characters whose paths are linked either directly or indirectly,and the differing paths their ultimate decisions take them on.The cast was well picked with all doing a solid job.The story starts off with a young European lady at a photog's place of business.The man is really a photog/pimp.He puts up clients photos on the internet,filters the incoming calls and sends his beauties out into the world to make money for himself and them.Her first job as Blanka,is to meet up with Jude Law,a visiting businessman,at a bar.As he walks towards her he is stopped by two businessmen he had talked to previously,who now,of all times,want to accept his offer.Law tells them he is going to deal elsewhere.One of the men spies Blanka and starts to ramble on about her being a hooker,even getting her pic and name on his phone.Law,to avoid embarrassment,has to leave the bar and stand her up.Later that evening in his hotel room,Law gets a call from the businessman who actually met and paid her.She told him Laws name.Their business arrangement will now be renegotiated due to what he has on Law.The scene switches to a dentist who has a thing for his assistant.He seeks help with his emotions with a therapist and his imaan.He even goes so far as to follow her to the airport.Law's wife,in the meantime,has had an on going affair with a young Brazilian photog who works for her company.Today she is having one last fling with him and ending her affair.The photog goes home only to find HIS Brazilian girlfriend has left him because of his affair with Law's wife.She flies back to Rio.Law returns home and both he and his wife are uncomfortable because of their individual personal problems that neither,of course,know about.The one thing they do have in common at this time is their young daughter.The scene switches to a convicted sex offender and his case worker.Seems the six year jailed convict is being allowed out and is flying home by himself.He is quite uncomfortable with the prospect,but his case worker is there for him.On a flight over the U.S.,the Brazilian girl on her way to Rio meets up with elderly Hopkins.It turns out he is a recovering alcoholic and is going to Arizona to identify a body which may or may not be his daughter,who disappeared some years before.Stranded at Denver Airport due a snowstorm,the two decide to meet up later for a drink at a bar.Fate intervenes and she instead meets up with the convicted sex criminal.She ends up coercing him back to her hotel room,and he is clearly uncomfortable.Her advances drive him to lock himself in the washroom.When he finally comes out she is asleep.Hopkins,the next day,worried seeks the girl out when her flight is boarding.He finds her and they say their goodbyes.Hopkins gets to his destination and finds the body is not his daughters.At an AA meeting that night he relates the background of his daughters disappearance(she may be alive).Also at that AA meeting is the dental assistant who is there visiting relatives.It seems her marriage is on the rocks and when she returns home she is telling her hubby it is all over.This she does,and just as he is leaving on a business trip.When she returns to work her conflicted boss tells her he has to let her go.Her hubby meanwhile has gone to the airport to meet his boss,who has some crime connections and is in town to to meet up with a girl he has lined up for him.It turns out the girl is none other than Blanka,but things don't go well.She calls her pimp who arrives and shoots the man,leaving Blanka at the scene unconscious.The hubby has watched things go down and flees the scene.Blanka's sister,who went along to every job with Blanka,had struck up a convo with the hubby earlier,and now decides to leave with him.Law's marriage has now recovered.And the film comes to its conclusion as we see all the major characters go across the screen,all on the new paths they have chosen/made for themselves.The last character study I recently saw was the Marigold Hotel,but unlike that,this one has its stars,but not to the same extent.Marigold's characters lives converged at the hotel,but here we have people from all over the world coming together in some way,shape or form,with some strand of commonality.I also found this movie far more satisfying than Marigold.The direction here is quite good,as is the editing to get all these divergent stories together to make a whole,coherent story.They also \"play\" with us a bit in this film.There is a moment when the sex offender is alone in the room with the girl flying to Rio.She is asleep and he is gently stroking her.The camera fades into next day and Hopkins is looking for her to say goodbye.We don't expect he will find her but he does.No,the violent moment is put off until Blanka sleeps with the criminal and it goes wrong.Nicely played.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include three featurettes.All in all a nicely done character study;well acted and directed.Recommended.",

"reviewerName": "E. Lee Zimmerman \"Trekscribbler (aka Ed)\"", "helpful": [4, 8], "reviewText": "I've said it before, and, if RITES OF SPRINGS teaches me anything, it's that it often bears repeating: almost anyone with an idea can write and shoot a slasher/horror picture these days, AND almost any studio will distribute it.  The upside?  The market continues to be flooded with good and ... erm ... let's say \"less than good\" product, and that keeps the consumers coming back to the trough for yet another scare.  The downside?  Well, because the dynamics of producing even a modestly-thought-out idea, video store shelves are stacked with one forgettable piece of garbage after another.Don't say I didn't warn you.After killing a local businessman's wife, a group of entry-level kidnappers nab his tween daughter to hold for $1 million ransom.  Hiding out in an abandoned school, the team of criminals is surprised when a blood-stained young woman stumbles into their hidey-hole ... with a maniacal axe-wielding killer in pursuit!  Forced to team up for safety, the criminals and the young woman realize they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, unless they can cooperate, they're bound to become the lunatic's dinner ... or something.This is Dumb.  Yes, dumb.  With a capital `D.'(NOTE: unfortunately, there's no way to review RITES without some spoilers, folks.  So if you want to know my final rating, then jump down to the last two paragraphs.  However, if you're up for some laughs, then read on!)Writer/director Padraig Reynolds bears the distinction of shooting the most ill-prepared slasher script I've watched in decades.  To his credit, there's some mythology here - apparently, the `barn creature' feasts only on the heads of five female victims once every first day of Spring, hence the title - though it makes absolutely no sense.  See, he has a keeper who - for reasons never made clear - catches the women for him.  The `barn creature' can't do it himself (or herself?) because he's kept locked in the cellar of a barn (?!?!) for the rest of the year.Not only that, but also the monster apparently has a fetish for munching only the heads of beauty pageant queens or other reasonably hot-looking women, though (again) we're given no logical explanation for that, either.  Instead, each woman is hotter looking than the one before, and, no doubt, we can figure out the subsequent lookers' fates once we've seen `em.Not only that, but also this ritual - Reynolds calls them \"rites\" for a reason, kiddies - has been going on for 25 years ... and yet no one has ever come up with the idea to simply close shop, take your good-looking women and children, and leave town every March 21st in order to escape the ensuing annual bloodshed and mayhem.  Instead, the townies go about their business like nothing's ever happened, and you can what happens from there.Not only that, but these characters aren't fleshed out enough to be anything other than stock fodder for the maniac's blade of choice in a script desperately in need of going under the knife.  There's the bad criminal.  Then, there's the criminal with a heart of gold who only has to take the law into his own hands because he's $300,000 in debt.  There's that guy's good-looking girlfriend (can you guess her fate?).  Then there that guy's mistake-prone brother (can you guess his fate?).Not only that, but, technically, the film stinks of amateurism.  Here's a tip: when making a film with a handicam or steadycam or hand-held camera of any sort, it might actually serve the process to stand still every now and then.  I have nothing against the herky-jerky documentary look of filmmaking, but, when you do it in a slasher film, you're constantly giving the audience the impression that you're seeing things from the perspective of the killer.  When that ain't the case, you're confusing the story!  And to complicate matters further, the story goes from daylight to nighttime in the flick of a switch.  Literally!  Guy goes into the abandoned school, and it's bright daylight; guy runs from abandoned school only moments later, and it's the dark of night.  Really?  Plus, as long as I'm piling it on, do you know any abandoned and clearly condemned schoolhouses fully equipped with mood lighting only?  I mean, maybe that's the reason that the schoolhouse was condemned, after all.  The school district should be ashamed of itself.To the film's credit, it ends.  However, the way it ends, makes absolutely no sense, and I (seriously) laughed for about five minutes.  I guess when Padraig Reynolds says cut, his crew took him seriously.  Stay tuned after the credits, though, because there are a few seconds more that try to ratchet up a few more scares ... or was that a few more laughs?RITES OF SPRING is produced by IFC Midnight, Red Planet Entertainment and White Rock Lake Productions in association with Vigilante Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds about as well as any scream flick probably can and should - not a bad thing, just nothing all that special.  A few sequences were poorly miked, but, when you're making schlock-horror on a budget, you take what you get.  The disc comes with a commentary track and some pleasant enough behind-the-scenes materials, if you're inclined to check `em out.  Again, nothing special, but it's nice to see that the cast & crew put some thought into some aspects of their tale; it's just too bad it wasn't in the script.NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED unless you're a glutton for punishment or in the mood for a cheap laugh.  It isn't that RITES OF SPRING is poorly made.  To the contrary, the cast and crew do they best they can to muster a few scares along the way.  It's just that so little of the script makes any coherent sense.  It's as if writer/director Reynolds had an idea - one based on a regular diet of slash and gore - and then he ran with it.  And why not?  Horror pics of this nature nearly always turn a profit, if not a few stomachs.In the interests of fairness, the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of RITES OF SPRING for the expressed purpose of completing this review.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "RITES OF SPRING Really Should've Been Called \"The Barn Monster of Rural Mississippi\"", "unixReviewTime": 1353024000, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A3EXWV8FNSSFL6", "asin": "B008RUCX3M", "reviewerName": "Daniel G. Lebryk", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Joe Garner is a nice guy, somebody you wouldn't mind hanging out with because he is, well, a nice guy. The hanging out wouldn't be wild crazy fun, just a nice good time. Craigslist Joe is a nice film, something reasonably nice to watch, nicely filmed, nicely edited, nicely done. Joe appears to be a kind non-judgmental person.At its core, Craigslist Joe is a road movie. The premise Joe Garner wants to spend 30 days living off Craigslist ads only. He's chosen the holidays, December 1 to December 31. At first I wondered if he would just hang out in LA and develop a life off those connections. Instead, the goal was really to do a lap of the United States. For a while I kept thinking about the problems with what he was doing, looking for the flaw in his goal and how he was going to accomplish things. Like why did he borrow a bike from somebody in LA and then take it with him to his next stop. Why the bike, how would he return it to the kind person, where would he leave it? This is fruitless reasoning in the film; it is much better to just take the ride with Joe.This film violates the road movie convention. There are always at least two people on the road. Where are John Candy and Steve Martin? Where were the Griswolds? What happened to Zack Galifianakis (well he is here, but more on that in a moment), Ed Helms, and Bradley Cooper? Shoot where is Thelma and Louise? No this film is all about Joe, one guy on the road. This is the huge flaw in the film, where it falls flat from a dramatic standpoint. There is no tension or drama built with traveling partners. There isn't much of a story built. At the end of the film, I had this empty feeling.On the one hand I loved this film. Joe is such a nice guy. He sets out on a 60's type journey, hitchhike the modern way, using the Internet. I'm sure Joe has incredible memories of his trip. The people along the way can be fantastic in the moment. Conversations all seem so deep. He did the take a summer off and backpack Europe into an American journey. All such a great concept. I hitchhiked across France and I can see how true his experience rang. I really loved the editing and visual language they used in the film. Given the hours and hours of footage they had to choose from, they did a great job piecing this together. I loved the maps and animations when he moved from one city to another. I also really liked the computer postings at the bottom of the screen, they added to the story. The film is a bit long at an hour and thirty minutes. I did find myself looking at how much time was left fairly often.Joe meets a number of tools during this trip. Because he wants to remain friends with these people, he is never judgmental; he leaves that up to the audience. Number one tool was Mr. Suit and Tie on his first stop. It wasn't a great start for the film. On the other hand, he did meet some amazing, nice, friendly, interesting people. Again, because he doesn't judge (verbally or with editing), the viewer can make up his or her own mind. The premise is also kind of strange. We get to hear a lot of the phone calls and what should be the first conversations. At some point I kept thinking, when did Joe mention that he was making a documentary? It is very difficult to imagine that part of the conversation or what Joe would say.Joe: Can I crash at your place / ride with you / help you volunteer somewhere?Person on the phone: Oh maybe.Joe: That's great, I'm making a documentary about using Craigslist to freeload my way around the country. We'd film you and your place.I can imagine the answer going either way. But in the end, it isn't the same thing as just asking somebody if you can help, crash, or ride. There's extra baggage. Joe needed to embrace that and break the fourth wall. He certainly breaks it with his direct confessions into the camera talking to us the viewer.One of the last meetings is really bad. It falls way flat and just sounds stupid in the film. Mentioning the person would be a bad spoiler.There was something that felt wrong about this movie. It was almost too slick, too well produced. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I read the credits. Zach Galifianakis was the producer of this film. It isn't clear he was involved before or after the 30 days on the road, but his influence is abundantly clear in the film. This film was not somebody outside of the Hollywood machine (Garner was a producer on Hangover II prior to this film), but a person that does have Hollywood experience. Documentaries tend to be made by people on the margin or outside of Hollywood. The editing of this film was particularly good; most documentaries are more hacked together. Drew Kilcoin was the editor - he has some decent movies under his belt (granted as first assistant editor), Flight, Beginners, and Texas Chainsaw 3D. Joe Garner managed to find some pretty talented people to help with his film post filming.A good resume is not usually a bad thing, except it takes a lot of shine off something that is a personal project with a simple premise. The production of the film removed it from that simple world.On the other hand, Kevin Flint, the cinematographer is a genius. He did an incredible job on this film. His camera work is excellent under the horrible conditions he had to work in. I would guess the film was all shot handheld, and he did a really good job. Kevin does not appear to be part of the Hollywood machine. It would be interesting to see a little bit of how Kevin kept up on the trip.A bit of parental advice on the audience for this film. The film is not rated. There are a few moments of strong language. There is no nudity, violence, or bloodshed. There are a number of scenes in bars and alcohol use. In theory this could be a PG film. Joe managed to completely avoid the sexual side of this trip. It is kind of hard to imagine nothing happened for a month that he never hooked up with anybody on the road, male or female. He pushes the PG envelope a lot during a visit with a dominatrix in Chicago. There is never any nudity, but the discussion is frank. Oddly Joe is completely asexual. The film is probably best left for a more mature audience.Overall this is not a bad film. It isn't exactly one of the best documentaries around. I dislike the gloss that was added to the film and I am automatically cynical about the Hollywood connection to this film. I think documentary should be independent film, done outside of that industry. I wish there was more of a story and there was a second person on this road trip. On the other hand, Joe is such a nice guy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Nice Guy Does A Lap Of The US WIth Craigslist", "unixReviewTime": 1372550400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN", "asin": "B00944CJRK", "reviewerName": "John's Horror Corner", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewText": "MY CALL:  Looking for a film that features vampire chicks, zombies, poltergeists, aliens and even has elements of a \"house movie?\"  Well, depending my interpretation of what I saw in the melee of clips from this film you may be in for all that and more...all be it in small doses.

For some truly idiotic reason--though quite convenient for this movie's concept--not one, but two of these criminals decide to videotape this crime.  They break into the house and find the owner dead in an armchair, sitting in front of half a dozen TVs that are still on, besieged by VHS videotapes.  Anyway, clearly one of these guys never saw The Ring because he happily starts watching the tapes one after the other, alone, in the room with the dead guy who was watching the tapes!  As he watches his cohorts search the rest of the house and we watch the short films that comprise this episodic anthology.  Like many such episodic horror film, the introductory story additionally moves on briefly in between the shorts with interesting developments.These short films vary substantially in film, acting, gore, direction and writing quality.  The first, fourth and fifth (out of five) short films were much better than the second and third, both of which were so mundane I'd be happier if they were altogether omitted at the expense of the film's running time.  Below is a summary of each short film.Amateur Night.  A group of frat-type guys, one with a spy-camera in his eyeglasses, go whoring around town with the ambition of getting tits on film.  The spy-wared individual, later quite inebriated, picks up a pale, squirrely, large-eyed girl (Hannah Fierman; The Vampire Diaries).  After a healthy dose of seriously drunk driving, acquaintance rape and group sex, their squirrely girl goes absolutely feral.  What ensues is purely shock cinema, as if it wasn't already testing boundaries, complete with murder sex, bloody full frontal male and female nudity, gore, and genital dismemberment.  [Spoiled by the trailer...SPOILER from here...]  This chick, which I can only describe as a cross between a rabid cat-woman and a vampire, is truly creepy, awkward, brutal, sexy and terrifying all at once.  [...to here. End SPOILER]  The story ends on a cheesy, yet appropriate note.  This was a great shock-short with very strong make-up and effects.Director: David Bruckner (The Signal) really impressed me here.  I'd love to see this as an entire movie, but I'm not sure how that would work.  Of course, I thought that about Splice, which turned out fine in my eyes.Second Honeymoon.  A young couple (Joe Swanberg and Sophia Takal) take a road trip out west.  After retiring to their hotel room for the evening a young woman (Kate Lynn Sheil) knocks on their door and requests a ride, which the couple denies.  After they fall asleep...I'm not revealing anything else about this short, not that there's much to spoil.  The couple's dynamic is entertaining to watch, but the \"horror\" of the short just wasn't there and the attempted \"shock\" at the end wasn't shocking.Director: Ti West (The ABCs of Death, The Innkeepers) disappointed me here.  He was going for ultra-creepy but delivered nothing but lame.Tuesday the 17th.  This short combined the teleporting Jason Voorhees killer concept with the Freddy Krueger dream-killer meets White Noise premise mached-up via Blair Witch's shaky video camera.  Sound bold?  Maybe too bold?  This short never had a chance to develop and the delivery was cheap, uncreative and poorly executed.  The gore was also poor, though abundant.  Want to know about the plot?  Four college kids go to a lake house.  That's right.  They go to a Cabin in the Woods and it doesn't pay off for them or the viewers.  That about covers it.Director:  Glenn McQuaid (I Sell the Dead) got one thing right here.  Camera tricks.  They're no longer original, but they perked my interest before I lost interest in this short.The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily.  A guy has a series of Skype dates with his long distance college girlfriend (the very cute Helen Rogers).  Over the course of these recorded Skype calls (even though in the film they complain that they weren't recording them--yet here some criminal is watching them on a VHS tape in a dead guy's house) they investigate her \"haunted\" apartment.  The mood is good.  The scares were decent and made me jumpy.  There is also some very effective head-turning gore.  Not really gory, but a strong sort of off-putting in a couple scenes.  The ending makes no sense and even leads us to scratch our heads and question the true genre of the short.Director:  Joel Swanberg (You're Next) did well.  I liked getting to know the characters.  I found their couple's dynamic credible and interesting in a way that served the story quite well.  And I liked that it could make me jump...sort of...internally at least.  You know what I mean?10/31/98.  Four bros go to a Halloween party.  But the house is empty.  They explore, a few odd things happen, and they find some Klan rally-exorcism-virgin sacrifice evidently transpiring in the attic.  The bros try to save the damsel under the assumption that the aggressive hillbillies rallying around her are the bad guys.  From here, what started out as a seemingly aimless short turned into a fantastically done \"house movie\" escape with cool effects, some of which felt unique to this film.  Pulse-ghost-zombie arms reaching through the walls and the floors, objects flying about, a window actually shrinks so as to create a sense that the outside world was closed off to the house's captives...  really nicely done.Director:  \"Radio Silence,\" a troupe of several young directors, impressed me.  What doesn't impress me is their troupe name, which makes it difficult for me to follow their work and upcoming projects on IMDB.Just because I disliked a couple of these shorts in no way means this wasn't a fun experience.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, we just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.IF YOU LIKE THIS WATCH:  Trick 'r Treat (2007), the Creepshow franchise (1982, 1987, 2006), the upcoming more scene-than-story 26-short The ABC's of Death.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one, just wait ten more minutes...", "unixReviewTime": 1350777600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2012"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B009F11B7Q", "reviewerName": "Dennis A.

The crew led by Commanding Officer Marcus Chaplin (portrayed by Andre Braugher) and Lt. Commander Sam Kendal (portrayed by Scott Speedman) pick up a U.S. Navy SEAL team off Pakistan's coast.While everything is going perfectly fine inside the USS Colorado, Lt. Grace Shepard (portrayed by Daisy Betts) receives an encoded message to launch nuclear ballistic missiles at Pakistan.But because a nuclear missiles on a country would kill millions and the fact the message came from a channel that would only be used only if the White House was destroyed, as Chaplin checks on American news, there is no mention of any problems in the United States.  So, Chaplin asks for confirmation from the U.S. government of why the order did not come in proper channels.Unfortunately, some of Chaplin's crew such as Commander Master Chief Petty Officer Joseph Prosser (portrayed by Robert Patrick) and others  question their Commanding Officer for not following direct orders to launch the nuclear missiles.Immediately, the Deputy Secretary of Defense William Curry dismisses Captain Marcus Chaplin for refusing to follow orders and Lt. Commander Sam Kendal is made acting captain. But before they launch the nuclear missiles, Kendal also requests the order to come in through proper channels.  Because of his refusal, an American tomohawk shot by the USS Illinois is sent to destroy the USS Colorado.While the USS Colorado is hit and there are a few casualties, the crew try to question why they were fired upon.  Meanwhile at the island of Sainte Marina, NATO is observing the tomohawk missile and seeing American government reporting it as missile attack by Pakistan.  In retaliation, the U.S. shoots two nuclear missiles on Pakistan.As America reports that the USS Colorado has been sunk by Pakistan, the USS Colorado rises underwater and the crew take over the Sainte Marina.  When they find out from NATO's Sophie Girard (portrayed by Camille De Pazzis) that it was the USS Illinois that attacked them, both Speedman and Chaplin are shocked.  To make things even worse, the government using other channels to communicate with other members of the crew try to get them to eliminate both Speedman and Chaplin.Knowing that their duty is to protect their crew and serve the United States, they record a video featuring Chaplin about how their intention is to protect the crew of the USS Colorado but because America tried to kill them, any country that tries to get near the perimeter near the island will be treated as the enemy.  And because there are 17 nuclear missiles, they will be used against any aggressor.So, as the USS Colorado makes Sainte Marina their main base, they must deal with the island natives who are not happy with the crew being on their island, they must deal with other countries trying to gain possession of the submarine (for its nuclear missiles) but also crew who are receiving messages from the government to eliminate Speedman and Chaplin for treason.  As the crew of the USS Colorado are also treated as criminals, Speedman and Chaplin must also deal with descending morale.Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Sam Kendal's wife Christine (portrayed by Jessy Schram) is being used by the government to get to Sam, meanwhile Kylie Sinclair (portrayed by Autumn Reeser) is trying to get information about the Perseus technology that is on the USS Colorado, a technology that she and her family built.  She knows from her govt. sources that the USS Illinois shot the Tomohawks and the USS Colorado and the USS government is involved.  But because of her knowledge, the U.S. government is watching closely over her, and worried she may be causing problems.With these growing problems, what will happen to the crew of USS Colorado?  And will they prove their innocence.VIDEO & AUDIO:\"Last Resort\" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. This is one of the few drama series on television where a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors, to there is good natural lighting and the series does look good on DVD. I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the series looks very good on DVD.As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music and special effects always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes. Did notice really good surround sound use for \"Last Resort\" with surround channels and rear surround channels being used.The show is presented in English SDH, Chinese, French, Korean, Spanish and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" includes the following special features:Making the Pilot - (4:18) A featurette on the making of the pilot.Profiles in Courage - (4:39) A featurette on the characters of \"Last Resort\" with interviews with cast and executive producers.Conn Artists - (4:29) The artists and production designer Jim Spencer and set designer Brenda Meyers-Ballard) talk about the conn room inside the submarine and how they design and built it.Anatomy of An Episode: Voluntold - (4:50) Behind-the-scenes of the making of the fourth episode \"Voluntold\" featuring director Stephen DePaul, Jessy Schram, Jay Hernandez, Andre Braugher and more.Grace Under Fire - (4:48) Dais Betts (Lt.

Who can imagine the Commanding Officer of shooting a nuclear missile near the White House?  Who can imagine how far a corrupt government would go?Yes, this is nothing new.  We have seen similar situations in dramas such as \"24&#8243;, we have seen betrayal of military members in films such as \"Platoon\", but what makes \"Last Resort\" so interesting is that it has never been done before.  A submarine carrying nuclear missiles and its crew landing in an island and literally taking it over.  An island where a drug runner has ruled hand over fist, a crew that is torn by its duty for the military without asking questions and a crew that is moralistic and would not nuke any country without a reason through proper channels.Throw in a cast of people who have their positives and negatives and you wonder how they will change, if they do change, throughout the series.Captain Marcus Chaplin, the honorable Captain who honors his country but also protects his submarine and its crew.  XO Sam Kendal, a man with honor but also a man who has been trying to find himself and possibly giving up too much of himself to the military, rather than to his wife.  Lt. Grace Shepard, the admiral's daughter but a woman who wants to prove that she got her position because of her skills and experience, not due to nepotism.Throw in characters such as the Navy SEAL James King, who he and his men are hiding the truth of what their mission was before being picked up by the USS Colorado.  Sophie Girard of NATO who has her obligations to her work but finds herself falling for XO Sam Kendal.Meanwhile at home, Kylie Sinclair tries to expose the truth about the government's lies, about a corrupt president and depending on Christine Kendal, wife of Sam, to bring out the truth of what happened to the US Colorado.And so many other characters that impact a storyline, similar to a series like \"LOST\", which may have many characters but yet, are utilized when the storyline is needed.There are so many things that could have gone wrong with \"Last Resort\" but the writing and the characters kept you coming back for more.  With that being said, it also comes down to one with an open mind, to accept things that may be farfetched or crazy.I can see some being turned off by how the series portrays a corrupt United States government.  How some may be turned off by military taking things into their own hands.  And perhaps the many characters and episode after episode of uncertainty.  Who is good?  Who is bad?  Will this crew member turn on you?  Or will the drug runners or the island natives end your life?It's not a simple series nor is the storyline simple...it features a complex conspiracy that tends to manifest until the final episode which the writers had to create closure and for the most part, they did.The series also has solid talent.  Andre Braugher does a magnificent job of playing Captain Marcus Chaplin and to see how his character evolves from beginning to end.  For Scott Speedman, it's good to see him play a role outside of \"The Underworld\" half Lycan/half vampire character or the problematic character on \"Felicity\" that he had previously been known for.Also, to see Autumn Reeser in another solid role, much different from the role that she was known for on \"The O.C.\".  And it's great to see international talents such as Australian actress Daisy Betts as Lt. Grace Shepard and French actress Camille De Pazzis as Sophie Girard.As for the DVD, \"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" features good picture quality on DVD with a good amount of shots done outdoors.  Also, a soundtrack that utilizes the surround channels quite frequently.  And there are also a good number of special features included on each of the three DVD's.Overall, I will give ABC the benefit of the doubt as I have seen many canceled series never receive any closure.  I'm glad the network gave \"Last Resort\" writers a chance to end the series, the best way they can.  It's an acceptable conclusion and so for anyone wanting a military drama that will be different than anything you have seen on television, a drama that is full of excitement and intrigue, then \"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" is a military drama worth watching!Recommended!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "\"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" is a military drama worth watching!", "unixReviewTime": 1372896000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A3UKLX2A9T589C", "asin": "B009FZFONO", "reviewerName": "TW Brown, Author, Editor, and Reviewer \"Todd ...", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "With the highest body count of any episode to date, the gore hounds will love this one. The episode does a several month fast forward--Lori is visibly pregnant--and hunger is a problem for the survivors. There is a scene involving a can of dog food that really sparked a conversation in our home. The AMC sync even had a question about whether or not it was right for Rick to stop Karl from eating it...surprisingly, almost 70% of the poll agreed. I'm sorry, but lack of protein and starvation opens up a lot of menu choices.One thing is clear, Rick is the leader of the band and his word is law. Karl has obviously been learning on the fly and is actually a help instead of the errant child of last season. (The best thing about that is that now we can focus on despising Lori for other things.)There is minimal dialog in this episode. The characters have to carry the episode with expressions and body language. I highly recommend watching this episode more than once just to observe how expertly these people stay in character. There is a great moment between Daryl and Carol that breaks the tension and earns some laughs.The early dilemma besides food is Lori's soon-to-arrive &#34;bundle of joy&#34;. The possibility of having the baby on the run is not appealing. When they stumble upon the prison, there is a belief that they have found refuge. All that remains is to clear it out. My only problem with that sequence was the number of blind corners. It leads to great suspense, but prisons are all about big open spaces and long, straight corridors.We get a peek at Michonne. She is on the move with Andrea, who is suffering from the flu or some similar ailment. It is clear that they have built a bond during their time since meeting in the woods at the end of season two.The effects are, as always, top notch. The best thing I saw was the return towards the storyline that those of us who read the graphic novels came to love.Naturally, the episode ends with a dramatic event. I don't think that this series needs to use hooks any longer. The fan base isn't leaving.Let's hope that this is what we have to look forward to in season three. For many, the second season was just a bit flat at times until the final two episodes.The episode one ending introduced us to some potential new characters...a group of inmates holed up in the prison cafeteria. Surprisingly, they turn out to be a &#34;less-than-desirable&#34; group. I was actually surprised that Rick tolerated them as long as he did. When things go sour--one particular inmate makes an obvious attempt on Rick in the chaos--Rick doesn't delegate to Daryl, and instead, gets the nomination for the &#34;Tom Savini Machete Kill of the Year&#34;. If that moment was not a direct nod to the original Dawn of the Dead, then it is the best unintentional homage ever!One of the most entertaining lines of the show has to fall into a similar category. There is no secret that Lori is possibly the most hated woman on television. She has been a regular &#34;bad Mother&#34; poster on an almost episodic basis. I believe that fans of the show got a &#34;We love you&#34; note from the writers and producers when Lori, during a scene with Rick, says, &#34;Look, I know that I'm a shitty wife...and I'm not winning any Mother-of-the-Year awards...&#34; Truer words were never spoken...Concerns over Hershel continue, and one of the best &#34;Made ya jump&#34; moments involves him and Lori. It is nice that Kirkman and company took a little veer off of the normal zombie track and allow for the possibility of survival of the area can be amputated (a fact that will be the doom for one of the inmates). Romero fans all recall the arm amputation scene from Day of the Dead.The honorary Boy Scout award goes to Carol. It is almost like taking a look back in time to when medicine was in its infancy. Before people were allowed to donate their bodies to science and grave-robbers were making a lucrative business delivering cadavers to would-be healers, the human body was a real mystery.In closing, with Rick's new attitude, how many people think that maybe he and Shane were really two peas in a pod. There is a harsh side to the aspect of survival that Shane understood from day one. His only downfall was his obsession with Lori.Overall, episode two hits the ground running and offers a few new &#34;questions&#34;...like who was watching Carol from the bushes...and where are Andrea and Michonne?Season 3, episode 3...or &#34;Merle, is that a knife in your pocket...or are you just glad to see me?&#34; Yes, there was little doubt that Merle would resurface. Honestly, as a fan of the graphic novels, I figured that he would become &#34;The Governor&#34;. Instead, they decided to give us a Ted Bundy type instead of the blatantly obvious bad guy.I must admit that I watch the AMC Storysync with each episode during its premiere. When questions come up like &#34;SHould Andrea and Michonne stay or leave, and a quarter of the voters pick &#34;Stay&#34;, then I have to wonder what the hell show they are watching. Whether or not you have read the series is irrelevant, The Governor drips evil. How is anybody missing that?This episode is all about Andrea and Michonne arriving at Woodbury. Now this tiny community of 73 (soon to be 74) citizens is just waiting to be exposed as a haven for evil. The question that remains is how many of the citizens are &#34;in on it.&#34; With Merle walking around free (but seemingly very much under the thumb of The Governor if you pay close attention to one scene) and a man in a dark lab performing experiments on the walkers (or biters as the Woodbury people call them), you just know the facade will have to crack.Right now, Michonne seems to be the only one keeping a healthy distrust. Andrea is either playing The Governor, or she is starting to sip from the Kool-Aid. That remains to be seen. However, if there is any doubt about The Governor, that is put to rest in the end.

But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's an update at the end of my review.]I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said \"In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story.\" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot-driven, rather than character-driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one-dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.Before you say \"They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?\" I expect good drama- character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful book THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT, he describes the behavior and bizarre \"reality\" of patients who've suffered right-hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV Series THE CROW, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN or the movie FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year-old boys with high-level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super-elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).[Update: I stand corrected- as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded &/or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's- especially their daughters'- imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that. All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think)- and the hit show BORGEN too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense. Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: \"Mix up the metaphors! Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing. Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!\" Or: \"Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity. HEY! How about SAVIOR- it's LOADED with associations, throw THAT in!\" Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amassed, how much convoluted but simplistic DRIVEL can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy- smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for.

Huston", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "\"Revenge\" is back and it really does offer a lot more than what we are expecting.  I just love this awesome world that ABC has created.  I think this series is the 'resurrection' of ABC's rise back to power.(Big Time Warning:  \"There will be spoilers!  You have been warned!\")Last season we were left with the shocking discovery of Emily's mother being alive.  Not to mention the \"supposed\" death of Victoria Grayson.  Was that a cliff-hanger or what!  We return with season 2 to see Emily searching for mother and putting her revenge plans \"on-hold\".  I know, something we don't want to see happen, but we do see some results due to it.  To add to the list, Amanda is struggling with her relationship with Jack, especially with her being pregnant.  Declan and Charlotte are back together (what a surprise).  And we have Daniel, who is grieving for his mother and also \"hooking\" up with Ashley.  Oh, yeah, and Nolan is homeless (thanks to ordeals with Tyler and the White-Haired Man in the last season).  The only one who seems to be doing well is Conrad.Now that we have that all cleared up, lets review on how this season was like.  And I will try to keep my spoilers to a minimum (but no promises).  ;)Well, the season starts off not so bad.  We see the return of Victoria Grayson (don't get mad at me for spoiling that, we all knew she wasn't dead) and also the search for Emily's mother, which both of these storylines will leave a big impact on the season (at least in their own way).  We see the development into the terrorist organization known as the \"Americon Initiative\", who have been mentioned in the first season.  Also, we meet a new character in this series, someone who Emily has a history with.  I will also spoil that we will see pretty good development between Amanda and Charlotte in the beginning of this season.  And there is more trouble for Jack and Declan, as they take on a new enemy.Okay, I will admit that this season doesn't exactly sound like what we were expecting from how season 1 ended.  I completely agree that this season does pull away from the direction of what the first season had in mind and heads down another.I will admit that there are tons of things that went wrong with this season.  First off, the \"Initiative\" storyline (which is the biggest one).  I saw plenty of opportunities to make that story a great mix into the world of \"Revenge\".  It starts off in a good way, setting up the threat of what the Initiative can do and what they plan to do.  But it is the mid-section of the season that really goes down hill with that storyline.  It even gets a little confusing.  Secondly, the Ryan Brothers.  Now this was a storyline that I really loved.  I like how we got to see Jack and Declan take on their own enemies and also deal with the consequences of their father.  It goes pretty well.  Until they add a very familiar face to the picture.  I won't reveal who, but I think you will figure it out on your own.  Thirdly, Emily's rebirth of vengeance.  Now, there is a major event that happens by the middle of this season, one that really works and really fits.  I won't reveal exactly what, but I will try to explain.  This \"major event\" makes Emily realize that she has been concentrating on the wrong road and manages to put her back on the right path.  At first, we actually think it works.  But.... it doesn't.  Instead we see her waiting for the right moment, while also taking on the Initiative.  And fourthly, NolCorp.  I won't spoil what happens to Nolan's company, but I will go a little bit into it.  There is a storyline that involves something happening to NolCorp and it really impacts Nolan.  But we do see Nolan plan his own \"revenge\" (title spoiler) for what happened and it is actually a good plan.  But we don't see anything happen with this plan.  Nothing happens at all.Okay, we have went through what was wrong with the season, but now let me explain how this season still holds up and why it isn't as bad as you think it might be.In this season, we actually see a couple of characters, that we really like, get killed off  (I promise I won't reveal who).  We see Emily go through some hard times that we didn't get in the first season.  We see her struggle as her actions have reactions on the people she cares about.  And all of this actually sets-up really well for the third season.  If you actually think about it, while this season may have messed a couple of things up, it actually allows a new direction to be opened up to fix all of it for the next season ahead.  Now that is pretty impressive.  In fact, I think this season was meant to be a showing of what happens when Emily goes off course and doesn't concentrate on her revenge.  It shows that things get out of control and people die because of it.  So, in my mind, this season really does offer the one thing we never expected to see:  \"reactions\".  We all thought that season 2 would just continue Emily's revenge, but really it was just setting up the plot for the consequences of her actions from season 1.  Heck, we even learn a dark secret about Jack and Declan's father, one that comes back to threaten them.  Even Conrad has a \"really big\" secret that comes back to threaten him as well.  This season is about reactions, not making more actions.So, do you think this season is as bad as you think it is?  I, for one, don't think so.  Yes, it does go off course and it does head down a new direction that messes a few things up.  But it does offer something that seems to fit this season.  There is development in this season and it really does adds more to Emily than we know.Even though it may not be better than season 1, it still holds up as a good season.  It could be a lot worse.  At least there are some elements that keep it from getting worse.  Besides, season 3 gets better and it fixes everything that was done wrong in this season.  I say buy it, because no matter what, season 2 still deserves to be enjoyed and watched.  Just go ahead and buy it!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "While the first season is better, season two still holds up and offers more than we think.

It does me no harm nor embarrasses me to compare the show to Cousteau's work or Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom with the equally great Marlin Perkins. Here, the explorers except one are amateurs. \"Bobo\" Fay, a man I know I recognize from TV or film from his work as a stuntman, is great comic relief and a Sasquatch believer extraordinaire.Matt Moneymaker, who may or may not have relatives in my hometown, is the self-proclaimed \"leader\" (the others lashed him over that mistake, since they consider themselves co-workers/equals). Ranae Holland, a lady I admire deeply, is the scientist (a field biologist who used to study birds, I think). The last good fellow is Cliff Barackman.Cliff Barackman is the reticent fellow--talks the least but works just as hard. This team comprises the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (hope I got that right, I always reverse \"field\" and \"research\" but I am accustomed to the arrangement \"field research\"). They go to particular places, meet with the witnesses town-meeting style, then get to investigating the three most credible witnesses.All of that is basically what the show is; however, I compare it to the other great shows of my youth because these folks are going out and doing the work those Old School greats also did for TV. One day, I know it will occur, they'll find and film a real Sasquatch. Some may disagree with me, but I believe Roger Patterson's 1967 film is the only authenticated and proved documentary of a real Sasquatch.In the first season, you may witness squabbles. That was unfortunate and I know the whole crew lashed out at their producer for showing that--they also nailed him for making them look stupid, which unfortunately he did. It seems they demanded a more honest, higher quality show.GOOD for them! If the story is true, my impression was they were ready to walk sometime after the 2nd season if things didn't change. For me, that is all I need to know I am seeing real explorers looking for a REAL animal. That's right, I said \"real\". The Sasquatch is real--but I often wonder if my generation will ever see another aside from Patterson's Bigfoot (who is nicknamed \"Patty\").Get this and just enjoy the relaxing pleasure of watching field workers who are not afraid of anything. The creepy locations where they find themselves often startles me, and watching Bobo, who is around 6'6\" and I will not hazard a guess as to his weight, running around in the wilderness...to use his expression, that is as \"squatchy\" as you can get.PERSONAL NOTES: I have given kudos to Matt Moneymaker for speaking out against David Paulides, and if you read my reviews of Paulides' books you'll know why:Missing 411-Western United States & Canada: Unexplained Disappearances of North Americans that have never been solvedandMissing 411- Eastern United States: Unexplained disappearances of North Americans that have never been solved.However, my big hero is Ranae Holland, an out-and-proud lesbian who clearly misses her deceased father. She always speaks of watching Bigfoot shows with him on TV--and he seems to have been a believer. That is touching, and I admire Holland greatly.UPDATE OF AWESOMENESS: Yes, I wrote awesomeness and I meant it. At the start of FINDING BIGFOOT's 4th season, a new special was aired that explored the cast members. It made my day to learn about them all, and I'm sharing it with you:MATT MONEYMAKER, the founder of the BFRO, as it turns out, is a lawyer more interested in Bigfoot education. Well, at least he graduated from law school and that made me admire him so much more--and it explains his manner of speaking plus his bossy attitude. What I loved about Matt, the only married cast member, is his wife is an M.D. and surgeon! (Or at least she was--I'm not certain she actually still practices.)CLIFF BARACKMAN gained much more respect in my estimation when I learned he produces fun DVDs about his own personal, off-show Bigfoot expeditions. They are hilarious and I think Animal Planet ought to share them. Cliff also holds a degree in jazz music and is a fine musician. The wife and I also admire his 15 years of service as an elementary school teacher. Along with Ranae, Cliff is all about education.BOBO FAY happens to be something of a 'chef', and in his heyday was a hell of a surfer. It saddened me to learn that his back is causing such trouble that he requires surgery. As I suspected, Bobo is extremely intelligent and utilizes his common sense more often than most people. We do truly wish him well in his upcoming back surgery; it broke my heart when he explained that his hands often do not do what he wants them to do.RANAE HOLLAND, about whom I learned nothing more than she seems more antisocial than I first assumed, apparently does love meeting and talking with people. Yet she avoided allowing the cameras into her Seattle home (the others welcomed the cameras in except Bobo, who allowed them to film the outside). As usual, though, Ranae managed to somehow say little yet make it all about how fantastic her physique is....But I know better than to simply 'judge a book by its cover'!If I may close with some suggestions for the happy continued success of this groundbreaking show: Ranae, easy on the skepticism! You're scarier than a Sasquatch throwing rocks! Bobo: no complaints. Cliff, pardon me deeply, but you come off as just plain goofy. Can you add some professorial notes to your regular speaking voice? And Matt! STOP SHOUTING! IT ISN'T NECESSSARY!!!And two last things: please stop doing so many Bigfoot \"calls\". It is irritating as hell, and I seriously doubt that it helps at all. Also, Ranae especially, when you chase what you think is a Sasquatch, DON'T trample all over the area where you saw it! Ever heard of \"evidence\"? Footprints? How will you gather any by doing all that trampling?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The cast fought to make this the quality show it has become today", "unixReviewTime": 1383523200, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A2FRKEXDXDN1KI", "asin": "B00AYB0YRY", "reviewerName": "Dennis A.

Picture quality for the film is very good!  Shot outdoors and trying to use natural sunlight in order to save money on the film, outdoor scenes are vibrant and colorful, while indoor scenes were well-planned and well-lit.  Closeups of the characters show plenty of detail in HD.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is primarily dialogue and music driven.  There is not so much use of the surround channels, so the film is center and front-channel driven. There are moments with an explosion and other scenes that provide good dynamic range but for the most part, dialogue is crisp and clear and original music by Liam Hayes and Roger Neill is also very clear.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES\"Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with writer/director Roman Coppola with interesting details of how the film was shot with a very low budget.A Glimpse Behind the Glimpse - The Making of Charles Swan - (24:54) A featurette about how the pop art film was inspired by the artwork of Charles White III, Dave Willard, Peter Palombi.  How the artwork was sexy, imaginative and playful and to create a film with that in mind.  Director Roman Coppola and producer Youree Henley discuss the casting of the film, working on a short budget, crew members talk about production design and more.A Glimpse Into the Mind of Charles White III - (12:10) An interview with graphic artist Charles White III.EXTRAS:\"Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:I watched a lot of cinema that may seem odd, abstract and while we expect to see these type of films coming from Europe and praise Fellini to even Jean-Luc Godard films for creating films that may not be comprehensive for the masses but yet intellectual and entertaining for those who are purveyors of unique, creative cinema...how are these films viewed if done today?Personally, watching \"Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\", it's a film that you respect Roman Coppolla for attempting.  You respect the fact that he is able to create something non-traditional and different from American cinema banality.But for some reason, I felt a bit non-ebullient towards this film.  Feeling that while funny and audacious at times, the fact is that \"Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" doesn't feel like cinema but almost like watching a home video of Charlie Sheen.  But I'll discuss what I like and didn't like about the film.What I did like about the film is the fact that Roman Coppolla wanted to create a '70s film and did it.  He may not have had a big budget for the film, but he was able to get his friends together and with what budget they had, were able to put together a unique style of film, that is reminiscent of a Fellini film and definitely not something you will see today in modern America cinema.What I also enjoyed about this film was how he and the crew were able to make do with what they have. May it be to shoot at his home, using wardrobe that he owned, utilizing natural light but staying true to his goal and focus of bringing in his inspirations in recreating the art that inspired him to make the film.While Coppolla has said this film was not designed for Charlie Sheen but was originally done as a character study, he knew that Charlie Sheen pretty much embodied the role of Charles Swan III.And the casting of Charlie Sheen felt right.  The fact is that the \"Tiger Blood\" infused actor is known for his partying ways and using whatever, drinking whatever and living or having fun with women and forever remaining bitter for his ouster on the hit TV show \"Two and a Half Men\".The characters of Charles Swan III seems as if it is a '70s version of the modern Charlie Sheen, but in this case, a man who tries to examine why his ex-girlfriend left him through various dreams and nightmares.  From one segment in which his former lovers say goodbye to him, but somehow he rises from the dead and partakes in a ballroom dancing moment with each woman who tells him how they feel about him.Another segment has an organization of women known as \"Ball Busters\" who try to blow him up and his best friend, Kirby.  Or another as they are cowboys discovering beautiful women as Indians.There are many more odd scenes that involve Charles, Kirby and his manager Saul or with his sister Izzy (portrayed by Katheryn Winnick).  And of course, many flashbacks featuring the disintegration of the relationship between Charles and Ivana.The odd flashbacks are not what I have a problem with as I have been more than open to watching many abstract films from all over the globe.  But with these films, there is always a message from the filmmaker that makes it a sign of the times, especially for that era.  Carefully planned shots of artistry.  And for the most part, using talents that have captivated you for their work in prior cinematic works, rather than public rants that were fodder for entertainment shows and jokes for late night television.The fact is that this film is perfect for Charlie Sheen, but it's a double-edged sword because the film is almost like watching the real Charlie Sheen and that is not what we want to see.  Set in the '70s, actor Jason Schwartzman is able to fit the role, even Bill Murray can fit the role that he plays.  But for Charlie Sheen, he and Charles Swan and their persona seem too alike and it makes you wonder...how much more can one take of \"crazy\" Charles?  But I'm not going to sound like I'm overly criticizing Sheen for this role because his reality embodies the life of Charles Swan III.  And most importantly, Sheen did put effort into this film, from rehearsing the dance number and even singing the Portuguese song.  Was happy to hear from Coppolla that Sheen worked on that!But part of my feeling a bit down on the film, I think that part of me expected something much more significant considering Coppolla has worked with Wes Anderson on films such as \"Moonrise Kingdom\" and \"The Darjeeling Limited\", but having listened to the audio commentary and special features, it set into perspective for me that this is a low-budget film created by one man's passion.  He wanted to create a '70s film and with what budget he had, he did it.  So, I do respect Coppolla for doing that.The chemistry between Charlie Sheen and Katheryn Winnick was also fun and the two clicked!  What is possibly the silliest part of the film but also my favorite are the two singing a Portuguese song.  The neon lights, the not-so-great singing but it just works.  Even the laughter in the song, I found myself watching this scene over and over!While we get to see Jason Schwartzman as Kirby Star throughout the film giving his two cents to Charles or somehow winding up in the wildest characters in Charles' dreams, the same can be said about Bill Murray.  While his character of Saul does not make it into the film that much, he does show up in various weird moments but also adds some star status to the film but plays a character who is also having his own relationship problems.  The same that can be said for Patricia Arquette as Charles' supportive sister, Izzy.  Who has two children that latch on to Charles.But the film has its numerous problems.  While a small budget can present numerous problems, I won't focus on that.  I just found the film to be random at times.  Which I'm very used too thanks to Italian and French cinema but I think the film tries to be imaginative and non-banal, which is a good thing but in terms of comprehensiveness,  for those wanting an easy to understand film may feel confused by how things jump around from dream/nightmare to reality in \"A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\".What is reality? I think it's obvious as Charles and friends in cowboy outfits going after beautiful women in Indian outfits are surely a fantasy.  His time with his sister is reality.  But what I wanted to see is more of Charles and Ivana, as each time they were together, I felt more drawn to the storyline thanks to their dramatic scenes.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is vibrant and colorful outdoors.  Night scenes and indoor scenes are well-lit and considering this is a low-budget film, set design and costume design were good, hair styles could have been made to match the '70s a bit more especially for Ivana but for the most part, the crew made the film work with the best budget they had.  Lossless audio is dialogue-driven and the special features do provide a good amount of information.  From Coppolla's audio commentary and the making of, but also the short interview with Charles White III.Overall, \"A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" is a film that is non-banal, imaginative, creative, unusual.  From its abstract use of reality and dreams, the storyline can get confusing, enjoyable, back to confusing quite easily.  While not a perfect film, for a small budget and what Roman Coppolla and crew were able to accomplish, \"A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" may not be for everyone.  But for those who are used to arthouse films that try to avoid becoming part of traditional cinema, may find the film to be refreshing and fun.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "\"A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III\" is a film that is non-banal, imaginative, creative & unusual.", "unixReviewTime": 1372896000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A34GZPHWYPSY2T", "asin": "B00B2EX4C4", "reviewerName": "E.

Shame on the voters who do this instead of considering an opinion, and shame on Amazon for expecting me to take my precious time to write a good review only to allow this type of shilling activity with the votes.GHOST MINE ~ general review which I'm putting under this particular episode, seasons 1 (2012) & 2 (2013) is yet another paranormal TV show I watch in order to relax and perhaps obtain a laugh or two. I chanced upon it while I was enjoying the obviously phony shenanigans of DEEP SOUTH PARANORMAL (see my review:Dead On The Bayouwhich is the only episode I was able to review).There is an important preface I think I should add. While the wife and I enjoy paranormal shows as popcorn entertainment and to get a few laughs, we're under no illusions as to their reality. In other words, we know these shows are all 100% fake (though I admit I'm a sucker for PSYCHIC KIDS). They hire actors for these shows, rarely any genuine non-actors. We see the bad acting in every episode; we often recognize the actors as being from other shows.Here it must be obvious the show deals with a haunted mine. This program appears to be influenced by the cynical personality who 'co-hosts' the show, paranormal investigator Patrick Doyle. While stiff as a board with about as much personality, Patrick is a fascinating creature. He is well known for his internet presence as a skeptic and harsh critic of paranormal shows. Recently his internet presence has vanished.So, he and his partner-in-spook-detection, Kristen Lumen (a skittish B-movie actress and hypnotherapist not to be confused with actresses Kristin Lehman or Kristen Lowman) both attached themselves to a gold-mining crew in Sumpter, Oregon. The mine, up in the Elk Horn Mountains, is called The Crescent, yields pretty pathetic gold, but BOY!!--is it ever haunted.The question with GHOST MINE is not whether the whole thing is fake, but rather: How many of the miners are real miners, and if there are real miners on there, how did they get mixed up in this fakery? As to Patrick Doyle (a former skeptic and hater of paranormal shows) and Kristen Lumen (a/k/a Kristen Luman, an awful B-movie bit-player) ... well, show me a paranormal show that DOESN'T have such people. They've got to earn a living!Yet Patrick and Kristen saw fit to attempt to erase their internet presence before going on GHOST MINE. Why do that? To generate publicity? You can't hardly erase your entire net presence, and Kristen is easy to find on the Internet Movie Database while Patrick has left huge footprints all over the web erasing his old skeptical web videos. Food for thought, readers.One thing I already knew which this show exposes is the horrific treatment of Chinese miners from the mid-19th century. There is an episode from season 2 (Massacre at Hell's Canyon) in which Patrick and Kristen travel up a river where several dozen Chinese miners were slaughtered.That is the 'spook-hook': it has to be those poor Chinese miners haunting the area. I watch this show mainly for the miners and their work. The show has an obnoxious soap opera tactic: you're left hanging at the end of each show, basically forcing you to wait a week just to discover what the hell happened. Without spoiling, I can reveal that it does resolve itself--pretty shabbily but dramatically--at the end of season 2 which just aired (I think the week of November 18, 2013).While I enjoy and even learn from watching the miners, I get bored as stiff as Patrick Doyle's lack of personality from watching the investigations. Patrick somehow keeps up his robotic lack of personality while Kristen unashamedly screeches at any little noise. It is pointless to name and describe the mining crew, which I suppose is just another mining crew. However, if they were real miners, I somehow doubt they'd accept a paycheck to be put into THIS kind of chum bucket.My wife and I have spotted (besides the lugubrious and annoying Kristen) at least three actors we have seen in other paranormal TV shows. However, when I think of the way pioneers in true adventure-expidition documentaries, like Marlin Perkins and Jacques Cousteau, also faked some of their material, well ... there's got to be some fakery, it's TV.At least Perkins and Cousteau were doing real work and bringing us real footage. I warn my readership to avoid wasting money on GHOST MINE. Watch it for free on cable and decide for yourselves. What the heck, one day Patrick might actually show some emotion or at least some life behind those shifty eyes--and Kristen might just finally learn how to act!What is occurring with these shows is sad. These shows are being put out there with the claim they are \"reality\"--in other words, DOCUMENTARIES. If an advertised documentary is not a documentary, then it is a fraud. Jacques Cousteau and Marlin Perkins faked some footage in every show they ever did, but they always admitted it; they were not trying to deceive their audiences.The true problem is we have a law that says there has to be a disclaimer that a show is for entertainment only, which signals that it is a faked show. That law seems to have simply fallen by the wayside--has everyone forgotten the Miss Cleo debacle? Or is it that everyone wants to forget! The disclaimer law I reference was a direct result of Miss Cleo's exposure.GHOST MINE has its strong points, and I have confirmed these by closely studying fan reactions on the internet. It seems the main catch that makes GHOST MINE unique and very popular is that it is essentially a soap opera. We know it is fake, but that's not always totally obvious--and that deceives people. Even so, we know how much we like it, and people described how they got hooked on the show.In other words, the people who put this together were raising the bar for these kinds of shows. Yet they also threw in with the other pathetic fraudsters who claim their shows are 100% real. I am a fan ofPsychic Kids: Children of the Paranormalbecause at least the children on that show seem genuine. Notice I wrote \"seem genuine\".I'm the first person to admire and applaud innovation--I even established a new branch of anthropology, called \"cinemanthropology\", to study tv/movie entertainment and its impact on human culture. What I deplore is the dishonesty, the fraudulent tactic, of passing off such work as journalistic-documentary work.Mine is not difficult logic: fraud is fraud, it's still illegal as far as I understand it, it cheapens/ruins what little integrity television has left, and (perhaps least of all) it insults everyone. As far as I can tell, GHOST MINE has never had any disclaimer nor have they made an effort to present one after the fact. Don't you think all of that places GHOST MINE and all the other paranormal shows in a kind of unacceptable jeopardy?", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "This TV trickery has some actual good ideas, but by all means pay Amazon to see something you can watch for free on cable", "unixReviewTime": 1383868800, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A2VMT89TCSF105", "asin": "B00B6870JE", "reviewerName": "Ashtar Command \"Seeker\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "Oh no, \"Ancient Aliens\" again.

His ideas or \"question marks\" about aliens visiting Earth in ancient times (in pyramid-like UFOs, to boot) must be *the* worst superstition ever spawned. Homeopathy and reductionist materialism, come back, all is forgiven! D&auml;niken's \"theories\" are so remarkably ridiculous in a kind of inimitable folksy style, with the main protagonist playing the role of fat German bar-owner spewing \"common sense\", that they almost make me weep! The fact that I used to believe in ancient aliens myself only ads insult to the injury. OK, I was only eleven at the time, but hell, I'm a perfectionist.And yes, I need to chill and have a candy bar, I know...OK, I'm back. Has \"Ancient Aliens\" become any better during my coffee break? Well...no. So here goes!I'm not necessarily opposed to rejected knowledge claims (avid readers of my reviews, all two of them, may have noticed a certain soft spot for Bigfoot and...ahem...John Michael Greer), but D&auml;niken's speculations really are annoying and extremely unsophisticated. D&auml;niken, a romantic adventurer of the classical kind, has no formal training in archaeology, anthropology or comparative mythology I'm aware of. Yet, he goes around the world, see mysterious stone structures, declare them \"impossible\" and...voil&aacute;, this proves that aliens built them! The magnificent stone structures at Puma Punku in Bolivia are declared \"impossible\", when a more reasonable hypothesis is that they *aren't* impossible at all - I mean, they are there, aren't they, and they are made out of sandstone, not moon rock. That the local Natives can't build them, and point to the sky as explanation for who did, leads D&auml;niken to conclude that...well, aliens did it. It's all so breathtakingly simple.Another example is Lord Pakal at Palenque in Mexico, debunked at least 10,000+ times, but still going strong. If looked at horizontally and with some creative imagination, the lid of Pakal's tomb looks like a guy manning a space rocket. If looked at vertically, using scholarly knowledge of Mayan mythology and iconography, the magnificent artwork shows Pakal being symbolically sacrificed. But no, D&auml;niken's folksy immediate impression simply must be true, or else no ratings for History Channel...Indeed, it's precisely the populist style, pitting independent researcher against the scientific establishment, which explains part of D&auml;niken's appeal. D&auml;niken is our \"audience substitute\". While everything you read in peer-reviewed journals isn't necessarily true, there *is* a reason why archaeologists need formal training, not just the ability to run around inside megalithic monuments gasping at the sheer \"impossibility\" of it all. There is another salient feature of the ancient astronaut milieu, too, one D&auml;niken is at pains to explicitly deny in this documentary. D&auml;niken says he hasn't formed a new religion. In a purely formal sense, he is right. He is *attacking* religion by a modern form of euhemerism, in which the gods are explained away in \"naturalist\" fashion as space travellers in nuts-and-bolts craft. What D&auml;niken doesn't want to see, but what surely almost everyone else spotted long ago, is that the belief in ancient astronauts is *in effect* a new kind of religion. At the very least, D&auml;niken is offering the masses a potent substitute for religion. The large amount of spiritual types who have climbed onboard the fiery chariot surely shows what we are dealing with. As for D&auml;niken himself, he even claims that the aliens created us and will return one day! Thus, he is specifically tailoring his speculations to an audience used to the *Christian* religion. I don't think Taoists, Shintoists or the Dogon in Mali eagerly awaits \"the return of the gods\"...Claude Vorhillon and his Ralians are the most obvious example of how \"ancient aliens\" can be turned into a religion (a religion which claims to be materialist, in fact). In their case, the quasi-Biblical traits are very obvious. Zecheriah Sitchin is another example of a person forming what is really a new religious movement around ideas presumably inspired by D&auml;niken's. And D&auml;niken himself? Isn't he really the exoteric attractor of the new creed, its Aaron so to speak? If you take the bait, I'm sure more \"esoteric\" people are waiting in the wings. I've heard that the Ancient Astronaut Society, which started as a D&auml;nikenite fan club, ended up as a New Age group. Thus, paradoxically the appeal of D&auml;niken's message could be seen as a combination of both populist anti-science and elitist \"hidden knowledge\", both modern irreligion and post-modern religion. An interesting object for a comparative religion study, I'm sure! These people don't understand that *they* are the ones that should be placed under the sociological and psychological microscope...The religious/Meaning aspect is surely the reason why so many people are oblivious to the (easily spotted) contradictions in D&auml;niken's books. How can aliens (that's *aliens*, for heaven's sake!) breed true with humans? If they can, why has no alien DNA been found in our gene pool? (Albert Einstein doesn't count.) Why would aliens need to build stone structures at Puma Punku, if they have super-advanced technology light years ahead of us? Why aren't there any *real* traces of a high technological civilization in India, if the Vedic peoples interacted with aliens? D&auml;niken's supporters point to \"mysteriously\" charred stone walls as evidence for ancient A-bombs, making you wonder why the bombs didn't obliterate the whole town, rather than just charring its walls...Seriously, should I continue?Are there real, unsolved mysteries in the universe? Oh, definitely. You already know which ones: where do we come from, why are we here, where are we going... And why *this* fun house of a planet? I'm willing to contemplate the erroneousness of materialism, the existence of Spirit, even one or two paranormal phenomena (although hopefully not on my favourite Swiss hotel). But literal, flesh-and-blood (or green jelly) aliens scaring the living daylights out of Moses, breeding true with female ape-men, and erecting stone structures of a suspiciously-looking human provenance all around the globe just for their higher amusement (and ours?)...naaaah. It's bad archaeology, bad anthropology, bad comparative religion, and - when push comes to shove - probably even bad spirituality.Erich von D&auml;niken and his fiery chariots is a legacy I would rather loose.

Who killed Megan's father?VIDEO & AUDIO:\"Body of Proof: The Complete Third Season\" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. This is one of the few drama series on television where a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors, to there is good natural lighting and the series does look good on DVD. I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the seventh season does look very good on DVD.As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes. Did notice the surround used in scenes with cutting of flesh (during surgery) which was quite clear. There are a few mild action sequences but for the most part, this is a dialogue-driven drama series.The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Body of Proof: The Complete Third Season\" includes the following special features:Getting the Shot - (4:17) The cast talk about Patrick Cady, DP Director of Photography and Patrick talks about his job and what he wants to accomplish with each episode.VFX The Ultimate Makeover - (3:11) The VFX crew discuss the post-effects used for \"Body of Proof\" and how they used visual effects to make the city look like Philadelphia and removing any trace of Los Angeles (ie. palm trees) from the series.  Also adding blood and guts for season three and more.All Kinds of Props - (5:32) Because there are more investigative scenes for season three, more props are used and this featurette goes into the props used for season three.Creating the World - (5:30) The crew that creates the world for \"Body of Proof\" and creating Philadelphia in Los Angeles and went into creating the episodes for season three.Body of Goofs  - (3:29) Featuring the burning down a house for an episode and what was involved in the creation of that scene.EXTRAS:\"Body of Proof: The Complete Third Season\" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:The final third season of \"Body of Proof\" was a season that would describe as action-packed, edgy and writers and cast putting it all on the line to see if this new direction will receive the green light for a fourth season.Unfortunately, Dana Delany has confirmed on Twitter that the show has been canceled, as fans who have supported the series have hoped that a new home on cable would be found.With that being said, my feeling of the third season is quite positive.  I felt the new direction was a good way to reboot the series featuring a more colder Megan Hunt, new characters and to focus on more action-driven, edgier storylines.  But the problem is whether or not people would accept it.Similar to \"Castle\" which features a novelist hanging around and helping out an investigator/law enforcement, \"Body of Proof\" went that same direction by featuring Megan Hunt now being involved in a variety of situations that most medical examiners never have to worry about.  From her daughter being kidnapped, from assisting an investigator and taking part in subduing a criminal, to having an escaped convicted felon breaking into her car with a gun to her head, a possibly possessed woman and an airplane going down near the city.  Meanwhile worrying about how her father really died and wanting to pursue it, as she doesn't believe her father died of suicide.In a nutshell, this describes the adventures of Megan Hunt for season three.You just don't really find medical examiners getting themselves into this much trouble and constantly around investigators during their investigations.But of course, this is television, where things don't have to equate necessarily to actual reality.  Action-packed and dark storylines tend to be the norm and what people want to see, along with very good acting and a solid storyline.The changes made for the third season was necessary.  I felt there had to be a change with characters and I really liked the chemistry between Megan Hunt and Det. Tommy Sullivan was there and Dana Delany and actor Mark Valley clicked on camera,I felt how they included Ethan Gross and Curtis Brumfield to the storyline was much better as they stayed behind-the-scenes and unlike Megan, got involved in action-scenes, it just didn't feel right to see these people trying to hide from criminals as their jobs are pretty much restricted to lab or on the field of duty.And as for Kate Murphy, the character pursuing a political career is actually conceivable and the conflict between her interested in the field and pursuing politics worked well for her character.  A much better storyline than last year's story of Kate dating Megan's ex-husband.Another positive aspect of season three along with the addition of Det. Tommy Sullivan is the addition of Det. Adam Lucas.  These two partners seemed right on television versus Detective Bud Morris and Detective Samantha Baker.  Past seasons, I felt the two characters were not integrated well into the series. Season one felt like comedy, season two they started to make these characters quite right for doing their job and for season three, integrating these characters for every homicide and have them take part in the action/drama was important. It took three seasons for the writers to get it right and I was pleased with how the detectives were utilized!And one final positive aspect to add to Megan Hunt's personality is by showing a vulnerable side to her.  And this is by featuring more of her mother Joan Hunt and her daughter Lacey.  The storyline about mother and daughter but also her past of losing her father and looking into his murder.Once again, something that is similar to \"Castle\" but with the \"Castle\" storyline being much bigger and corrupt, with this situation, at least it ties itself up by the final episode.As for the DVD release, picture quality for \"Body of Proof\" is very good, dialogue is clear and understandable and there are several special features included with the third season DVD set.I'm not sure if the creators or writers anticipated a possibility that \"Body of Proof\" would not be coming back for a fourth season, but since this is a final season, the good news is that the series does answer a lot of questions in regards to how Megan Hunt's father had died and the series ends with an outcome that fans of the series can be content with.I felt the cast and the writers did everything possible within their limits to making an exciting and enjoyable third season but the fact is that television is changing and there are more options of entertainment that people can tune into.  \"Body of Proof\" didn't do poorly in the ratings, it actually does better than other series that are still on television but for ABC, whatever reason they chose not to continue it, may it be due to the cost per episode or their ratings barometer is too high, this was the best season of \"Body of Proof\" and I enjoyed it.I'm grateful to Dana Delany, Jeri Ryan, Geoffrey Arend, Windell Middlebrooks, Mary Mouser and many others from the cast and crew for three enjoyable seasons. They battled hard to keep the series on air but in the end, they delivered when it came to giving one hell of an exciting season for the audience.So for those who have followed and purchased each of the first two seasons of \"Body of Proof\", this final third season is a worthy purchase to close out the series.\"Body of Proof: The Complete Third Season\" is recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "(4.5 Stars) A new edgier, action-packed direction for the final season of \"Body of Proof\"", "unixReviewTime": 1372896000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A3J1L5HC0RMCDX", "asin": "B00BT4MT8W", "reviewerName": "Anonymous45 \"michael cifelli\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I have read other people's reviews. Douglas Meeks has it right on the money. I suggest you read Mr. Meeks review. AS I see it, and i have seen every episode since day one, every season, and i own all 8 seasons on dvd. Mr. Meeks is correct that if you have not seen it, which really blows my mind if you haven't, but if not, go to season 1 and start there, and it will be really fun for you as Mr.Meeks says &#34;to see the evolution of the show&#34; over time. This season they added more chef's, 20 I belive instead of the normal 16 chefs. This is to create more episodes with drama, as in throwing two off the show instead of one, throwing more people out of the kitchen but leaving enough to finish the service. Having more people will give the show more variety and flexability in terms of what kind of drama it wants to present.It is the woman vs the men and for some reason this season is a bit different despite my title &#34;More of the same&#34;. I will try not to give anything away. The men cant seem to win anything. The woman seem to work much better as a team. They have a variety of people. I like to try to pick the final two before the season even starts. I have had some success. Gordon does not like to hire older people, he always favors the young as nobody over 39 has ever won. And as Gordon has said when Christine won over Petrosa, &#34;i have to think of the future&#34;. He also does not favor anyone over weight. Nora i think was her name, she was the first person, who was over weight that ever won. I also think they waste their time bringing in anyone who is in their late 40's and in this season they have a 51 year old. Does anyone really think Gordon will give him the job? So for me it's a waste of time. The good thing is that the contestent who is 51, he is actually one of the better men chefs and this exposure should help him get better employment doing what he loves to do if he had otherwise not had been on the show. I also think because the woman are doing so well, it does make it harder to figure out who will be in the final four never mind the final two. So i think out of all the seasons, this season is the toughest to figure out who will be there in the end. One review said they had a trouble maker and it seemed staged. This show is a lot of things. But Staged is not one of them. Before season one started, the station, Fox, had suggested to Gordon a script and what should be on it. Gordon said, &#34;If you want me to use a script, you can stick it up your ass, and cancel the show.&#34; If he wont use a script, he certainly wont stage anything. The people are what they are. What you see is what you get.This show also has the return of JP who runs the Dining Room. Although I think they have not used him near enough, and the humor of the show is lost due to their under utilization of JP. In past seasons, you have JP vs the wedding planner, or JP showing up on a boat with those silly tight pants, or Gordon throwing JP into the ocean. Yes those things might be a bit planned. But still very funny all the same. That humor is missing this season. Also, usually if one team is losing really bad week after week, Gordon will send someone from the better team over to the losing team to help balance things out. He has not done that this season. Not yet anyway. This show is still great, funny, and always still new things to see every season. Im really curious to see what Gordon does with the older and over weight people? To me, if you are not going to hire them no matter how good they are you shoul not have them on the show. Just my opinion. Although the season with Rash was great. He was older and over weight and he just added to the humor. Some seasons you have crazy people, hot girls, sexy hot tub scenes (Holly and Jay), tough guys, woman with really bad tempers, all kinds of personalities. This season, i don't get that kind of they are nuts feeling. The opening episode was great. They did it live at  Vegas in front of 5000 people, the signature dish that is. If you like the show, or in my case love the show, you will not be dissapointed. The show has all the usual things you love season to season and a few new things which i mentioned. But still mostly the same show. And after ten seasons, and in it's 11th season, I don't think I am wrong in saying it's still in my humble opinion, the best Reality tv show on any station. You cant go wrong. Rent it, buy it, I say just make sure you watch it. Remember JP is back!!!Okay, I have to add to this because it seems that you cant do a review for each episode like you use to be able to. If its me please let me know okay? This season is very strange. For example. On the mens team they let the goofy guy dan? I think that is his name. One week the team is picking on him, and Gordon does not like it when you let yourself be pushed around as a woman or a man. But Gordon said &#34;you can really cook&#34;. Dan got over confident in my opinion. The next week, I believe it was between Dan who Gordon said could really cook, and the other guy who shaved his head to prove I don't know what, and Gordon got rid of Dan. Here is the kicker. The guy who cut his hair served &#34;RAW CHICKEN&#34;. BUT HE SACKED DAN. Now on the girls team, the one girl was doing well, I thought there were several other girls they could have let go, one of the girls who went up for elimination served &#34;RAW CHICKEN&#34; and she did not get sacked. The other girl did. This is a first. And it's not fair. Another thing I don't like, is that in every season, if one team is getting killed, especially when it was the girls, they send a strong member from the other team over there to help. Remember Giavanni? he went over to the girls team and they one their first challenge cause of it. Point being, The girls have won 8 challenges, the men won only 1 challenge. Im sorry, this is really wrong in my opinion. I also think they are doing this to throw us off , the audience as to say &#34;see , two girls in the finale&#34;. I don't think that is the case. In fact, I think it will be one girl and one man, and I believe a man wins it. I think this is all smoke and mirrors. But in doing so? They are making it so miserable for the men. And they will be far more exhausted at the end going into the finale.I also would not be surprised that it would be two men. Only because Gordon has only hired one over weight person who was a woman. He goes with young, and thin....Tonight's episode was also strange. Zack who has been great all season long, all he did was for two minutes the entire episode , he had to make more potatoes. That was it. And Gordon said if he did it again he was out. This was a complete over reaction. And to me it just seems to be more of a magic trick to change direction on us so we don't know what is going on. I do. I think...lol Woman are killing them. Don't be surprised if its two men at the end, or one man and one woman, and a man wins. Attacking Zack ,one of the best chef on that team, it made no sense at all. I mean none. If he throws him off, then this show loses all credibility with me completely. And I love this show and own all DVD's, and all seasons on Amazon. And everything else he does. But this season is not flowing the way it usually does. He throws Dan off and he did not under cook chicken. The guy who did got to stay. The woman who also under cooked the chicken did not get thrown out. Why did he not KEEP Dan? He did not under cook anything that night? The guy who served raw chicken got to stay. I think its a way to throw us off.Okay, we are down to 8 chef's left. I have to edit my review in order to keep writing. You cant write about each episode. I will say the show has flowed much better than i originally thought. Some good humor in there. They did not have the same chemistry between Chef and JP though. I think it was a good season except when they got down to 9 chefs then Gordon decided it was time to send someone over there to help the blue team? that was the only thing that really bothered me. I think he should have done that much earlier in the season. So i will give my two picks now that Zack in my opinion has completely gone off his rocker. Ja'Nell and Jon will be the two in the final. Jon wins. This is only my opinion. We have 8 chefs left. It will be fun to see how it goes. Overall a another great season.

Actually, NEGATIVE FIVE stars if I could.Wow. I can't believe how bad this film was. It actually became excruciating about halfway through. I had to force myself to keep watching it, so that I could write a review. This film should be taken down immediately, and all copies, draft materials, and anything else related to it should be destroyed. It cannot be salvaged. You'd be better off starting from scratch, than trying to save this film. This is one of the most detestable, deplorable, despicable movies I have ever seen that has tried to tout itself as a \"family film\". Good grief it was bad. How bad was it? The most morally admirable character was the VILLAIN, \"The Flamingo\", and he's obviously not that morally upright. I would say that this film was written by a disbarred lawyer, but even disbarred lawyers are familiar with the basics of ethics and morality. The writers of this film seem to have no understanding, nor familiarity with ethics.Perhaps the greatest reason that superheroes are a classical storytelling device is the fact that they offer the opportunity to draw clear delineations between what is right, and what is wrong. Superheroes often face moral dilemmas, but what makes them superheroes is the fact that they make the right choices, no matter how hard it is to do what's right. Otherwise, they're superVILLAINS. Superpowers, super abilities, and super tech do not make superheroes. CHOICES make superheroes.Now let's examine the choices that this \"superhero\" family makes.Although the father recognizes that he needs to \"protect his family from a murderous mainframe\", when faced with the financial repercussions of possibly losing his house, he caves stating \"fine, just don't blow up my house\". So, finances trump family? Got it.Furthermore, the father loses any reluctance about the arrangement with the \"murderous mainframe\" once it becomes obvious to him that he can use the Grim Avenger tech to make his personal life better by using it for chores.After seriously scorching his neighbor's house using a laser to trim hedges, rather than try to repair the damage, or make reparations, or even confess to it, he runs and hides like the deadbeats who hit someone's parked car in the parking lot and leave without taking responsibility.The wife agrees to go to (in her own words) \"a dinner date\" at one of the most expensive restaurants in town alone with her gorgeous playboy coworker. All of the professional, married women that I know don't eat meals with nor travel with male coworkers alone, but only in a group.When it becomes apparent to the father that \"The Flamingo\" is rampaging across the city in order to force a showdown, the father chooses to address largely invented family emergencies instead, at the cost to countless other families.To spy on his wife on her dinner date with Richard, the father implants a Grim Global Positioning Tracker in Richard, even though he's at first horrified by the danger of implanting it in someone's spinal cord (but, hey, it's okay if you don't like the guy, right?) because he's \"protecting his family\". Evidently, trust for your spouse isn't requisite in protecting your family. (And later he ironically berates the computer for invading his daughter's privacy by checking Facebook.)The father, rather than allow Richard to drive away with his wife, destroys Richard's Corvette.The son, upon acquiring one of Grim Avenger's power gauntlets, and after destroying a neighbor's treehouse, rather than make reparations, or a confession, cuts and runs (perhaps taking a cue from his father's lack of moral compass).The son uses the power gauntlet to bully a bully (becoming the evil that he had resented and detested).The father constantly shirks his end of the bargain, doing everything that he can to avoid training and crime fighting.The father uses the \"Hypno Spray\" to brainwash the most popular boy at his daughter's school in order to completely reform him and force him to be his daughter's boyfriend, then congratulates himself with \"THAT's how to parent!\"The father uses the x-ray goggles to cheat at the scratch-off lottery, by finding winning tickets.The son and daughter abandon her tasered, unconscious boyfriend on their porch, because they're busy fighting over who gets the power gauntlet.The father uses the Grim Avenger super car just to get to his wife's dinner in the city, then uses the Grim Avenger persona to save her presentation by offering the persona for marketing purposes. (Then berates his children for using the super car to cheat \"whenever things get hard\", but never realizes how hypocritical that is.)The father allows his children to use the super car to get to school, so that he can continue to do marketing as the Grim Avenger for his wife. (Then is surprised when they abuse it to skip school and become more popular.) This also potentially endangers his family by exposing his secret identity, but the show never addresses this. It also eventually leads to \"The Flamingo\" gaining control of the super car, but fortunately for the city all he cares about is revenge, otherwise the city would have been screwed, no thanks to our \"heroes\".The daughter uses the automated super car to cheat and pass her driver's exam.The son speculates about selling Grim Avenger tech on eBay for money.The son uses tattling about his sister's using the super car to pick up friends so that he can get out of trouble for skipping school.The father puts his children in danger by pursing criminals with them just to show them how important of a responsibility it is (even though it's the first time that he's bothered to do any crime fighting).In answering his last chance questions, the father makes it clear in his answers that his family comes first, no matter the cost to society and the city. The movie deems that to be a virtue. What happens to the superhero (or superspy) families that were willing to put their families on the line for others? That viewed the well-being of society as higher than their own well-being? Since when is selfishness a virtue? Disregard for others? Unwillingness to sacrifice?The family abandons a helpless, tied-up Richard in the same warehouse that had previously exploded and killed the prior Grim Avenger.The movie tries to have a huge moment at the end in the final fight where the father \"realizes\" a bunch of things like \"heroes don't need masks\", but he doesn't actually realize anything meaningful. He comes off as a groundlessly cocky jerk, not someone who has been on a revelatory journey. It's trite, with all of the moral goodness of twinkies.The movie ends with the family continuing to try to find ways to pimp out the Grim Avenger persona for marketing money. (Then the father laughably asserts at the end of the film that \"This city needs us\" even though the opposite has been shown throughout the entire film.)So how's \"The Flamingo\" the most morally upright? He goes out of his way to make sure that his actions don't cause physical harm, almost to a laughable degree. On the other hand, the \"superhero\" family runs him over with a car, uses the \"Hypno Spray\" on him to brainwash him so that he can become their personal lawn care help rather than turning him in to authorities, and when the \"Hypno Spray\" wears off, they have a deadly robot ready to threaten him with physical harm if he doesn't trim their hedges. Nice. I'm so glad that a family with such a high regard for human life, and no propensity for abusing power has been granted so much power. (Please note the sarcasm. Please?)Much of this would have been fine if there had been morals to any of these experiences where the family learned that what they had done was wrong, and that there are more important things in life than themselves. This isn't the case at all. It's the opposite. Everything works out despite them not learning any lessons, and merely reinforces that they can cavalierly do whatever they want at the expense of any others. Most of the immoral and unethical things that this family does end up having ZERO negative consequences for the family (although, the same cannot be said for the innocent public who is saddled with this supervillain family).The problem with this film concept is that the family is detestable. The computer is right: they don't deserve access to the Grim Avenger's tech. They abuse it, and constantly put others in danger as a result. Their most dominant trait is family selfishness (they aren't necessarily selfish individually, but their family as a group acts selfishly towards the rest of the world). They act as if their family and the happiness of the family justify any other type of action, no matter the repercussions for the rest of the world. If this family has to choose between either doing the right thing OR being happy, this family inevitably chooses to be selfishly happy. This family is closer to a family of supervillains, then a family of superheroes. Like supervillains, they use their powers for family gain rather than for the betterment of society.This show is detestable for its lack of ethics, and tone deafness, and is likely unsalvageable. Relegate the whole concept to the trash heap, or be honest, and make a show glamorizing a supervillain family.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "DO NOT WATCH!!!

Of course, most of the actors were already known as great actors prior to being cast on Hannibal. One also gets the sese that they rise to the material, because the writing is also really great, with few false steps. Rarely is there a moment of over-reaching. When there is, it's usually Dancy -- but considering the emotional and physiological extremes to which Will Graham is driven by the season-long story arc, it's understandable (and forgivable) that he might slip: he's the one consistently put farthest out on a limb, much more so than any of the other actors.If you enjoy intelligent psychological thrillers and detest the degeneration of the horror genre of film/TV into two main camps of slasher/gore-for-gore's-sake and romanticized monsters (e.g. vampires, werewolves, various now-cliche supernatural phenomena) (not including BTVS, of course, which transcended its genre trappings), then you will like or maybe even love Hannibal.If you really dig gore for gore's sake, you probably won't like Hannibal -- it will be much too &#34;talky&#34; and high brow for you. But those are the things I love about it, the juxtaposition of violent, nefarious crimes with the intelligent dialogue and dramatization of the snaky interrelationships of the people trying to solve them and catch the killers.Occasionally the series slides into gratuitous gore. So you also have to have the stomach for that. Because when there is gore, it is extremely gory gore. However, for the most part the gore is deployed judiciously, if in ways that threaten to puncture one's suspension of disbelief.*In many ways, the serial killer angle of the Hannibal series is merely a device to lure you into what the show is *really* about: psychopathology, and the many ways in which psychopaths not only live, but thrive in modern society... and how their actions and manipulations affect our lives. A subset of that is the ways in which we all exhibit some behavior on the spectrum of psychopathology, even with good intentions. There is for that saying about &#34;the road to hell&#34;...Hannibal's set design, costume design, cinematography, and sound design are gorgeous, multilayered, and of very high production values. It is clear extreme thought and care go into composing the scenes, filming, editing, sound track and score. Virtually all the main characters are impeccably coiffed and dressed, not to mention attractive in their unique, individual ways. The nightmare, hallucination, and dream sequences (mostly those of Will Graham) are similarly well done (with the exception of my one pet peeve**), contrasting their brutal, messy details and archetypal symbols with the otherwise highly stylized &#34;reality&#34; of normal, everyday life and objects.This perfection of composition is clearly intentional. Make no mistake: this is not realism. It is utterly stylized super-realism. There is none of the grit of noir or neo-noir production values. Such stylized set design makes those who are less perfectly dressed and coiffed, and the gore, that much more obvious by contrast. For the most part, the less perfectly dressed and coiffed, the more likely the character is a killer or criminal; the more perfectly dressed and coiffed, the more likely the character is to be &#34;good&#34; -- with two notable exceptions, of course: Hannibal and Will Graham. (Another exception is Hannibal's neurotic but otherwise decent patient Franklin, whose story arc provides some ominous foreshadowing of Will's story arc.)Will is tousled, sweaty, stubbled; he frowns and smiles lopsidedly; he has tics and grimaces; his losses of composure and mind, privately or publicly, are noticeable and messy. Whereas Hannibal is exquisitely dressed, utterly composed, with not a hair out of place, rarely if ever ruffled, like a pond that wouldn't ripple even if a boulder were thrown into it.Will lives in an old frame house with older and obviously lived in/used furniture with several dogs and lots of stuff; Hannibal, Jack Crawford, and Dr. DuMaurier and those colleagues whose homes or work places we're allowed to see all live and/or work in beautiful, well-ordered homes or offices with high end furnishings and decor, not a book out of place (even when there are so many, as in Hannibal's second level library, which I seriously envy).This illustrates perfectly the dichotomy with which most of us are constantly, if unconsciously, faced: the deceptiveness of perfect and beautiful surfaces, our instinctual attraction to and sympathy for symmetry and beauty, our instinctual suspicion and quick judgment of imperfect and asymmetrical people and things.The equating of beauty with normalcy/goodness and lack of beauty/imperfection with abnormalcy/suspicion is a constant subtext of this show. The entire first series and the two main characters provide an object lesson in why one should never judge a book by its cover, especially when confronted with non-neurotypical individuals such as Will Graham. He is, of course, much more of a genuine human being than the perfectly stitched together, and impeccably tailored &#34;person-suit&#34;  of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (as described by Dr. DuMaurier, Hannibal's therapist, played by Gillian Anderson).One of the early points of the series, made by the tabloid reporter Freddie Lounds, is that psychopaths (sociopaths) can and do live and work among us. If you haven't had the misfortune of being romantically involved with or blood-related to one, you have almost certainly worked with or been acquainted with one, or maybe been the victim of the bullying of one. You may wonder how they sleep, doing what they do. The thing is, they don't recognize that they are doing anything all that bad; they play with people rather than truly befriend or love them. You may wonder how you fell for it, too, if you have fallen for it. But these people wear well constructed &#34;person suits&#34; that allow them to pass as normal, well-adjusted, even successful colleagues and peers. It is only when you get to know them intimately that the facades begin to crumble -- and, just as often, it is when someone breaches their walls and gets to know their &#34;real&#34; selves that they become increasingly interpersonally cruel, in ways others can't see.Yet the mind games that highly intelligent sociopaths play with the people around them, overtly and covertly, and the enjoyment they derive from manipulating people, are dramatized in this series with an interesting twist: their narcissism is exposed to show its internal hollowness; their lack of identity is portrayed eerily objectively rather than as subjectively evil.There is a detachment in the writing of Hannibal that allows the viewer to make up his or her own mind. Of course, everything in the production -- from acting and set design to cinematography and sound design -- highlights and isolates the casual manipulation and psychopathology against a beautiful, deep backdrop of (1) well-intentioned good guys trying to catch bad guys, (2) well intentioned therapists, psychologists, and criminalists trying to help direct and ancillary victims, and (3) not so well intentioned characters out for themselves, or prioritizing an interest (however well intentioned) that subordinates the well being of the person they appear to be trying to help or befriend.Yet Hannibal's psychopathology is portrayed almost sympathetically. (It goes without saying that that of some of the other criminals, questionable characters, and that of &#34;good guys&#34; like Jack Crawford and Will, are as well.)This allows for portrayals of psychopathology along a spectrum, from &#34;everyday psychopathology&#34; to true insanity and evil. The injection of the fact that physiological illness can create symptoms of mental illness, identity disorder, and psychopathology further muddies the waters.It's tempting to say that Hannibal is &#34;full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&#34; -- and yet by viewing these fictional characters in their milieu, we start to examine our own lives, our own &#34;everyday psychopathology&#34; and that of those we know. At least, I certainly did. I've known people like Hannibal, in character if not in deed. I've been involved with one romantically, and a lifelong friend of mine was lured down a primrose path by one he thought was a true friend. You may think such things can't happen to you, and maybe they haven't. If they haven't, it wasn't because you didn't know anyone like that -- it was merely because the ones you knew didn't find you worthy: they simply didn't &#34;pick&#34; you.Lucky you.When you watch Will's descent, and the failure of other main characters to recognize that which they're trained to recognize, you feel incredible sympathy for Will Graham. The audience always knows the truth, so watching the cat and mouse is often wrenching. Yet it is fascinating and even while you know what Hannibal is doing, Mads Mikkelson's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Hannibal is remarkably sympathetic. He may be the most sympathetic serial killer ever portrayed.That's how psycopaths suck people in, isn't it? We know better -- we *know*, instinctually, or at least *sense* that there is something wrong with them... but enough is &#34;right with&#34; them that we think they can be befriended, loved, helped... saved.Hugh Dancy's portrayal of Will as high functioning non-neurotypical/autism spectrum sufferer is done quite well in the early episodes, subtly &#34;off&#34; the way that such people are and can't help. (His autism spectrum condition is never named as such, similar to the way Diane Kruger's character Detective Sonya Cross on FX's drama The Bridge is never identified as such, though both are clearly on the spectrum). His Asperger's-ish symptoms seems to wax and wane towards the middle and end of the first season, but that may be in proportion to what the character is put through. It isn't entirely realistic -- like the rest of Hannibal -- but the portrayal feels very authentic nonetheless.It should also be noted that, as with The Sopranos, Hannibal is very much about the process of psychotherapy. Issues of transference -- and counter-transference -- not to mention the inherent social weirdness and the 'one way' direction of analytical/psychotherapeutic intimacy are portrayed along with identity crisis, dissociation, and the blurring of lines between therapist, friend, and colleague.These are highly intelligent characters with advanced degrees, many of whom are pathologically incapable of not analyzing everyone around them and their own relationships with them. Yet they have their personal and professional blind spots, too, and we see that, even for them, &#34;people see what they want to see&#34; --even those who are intentionally hiding things, whether for good or bad reasons or intentions.Dr. DuMaurier's nondirective reflection of Hannibal is contrasted with Hannibal's directive (and secretly manipulative) treatment of Will, though both Hannibal and Will maintain that Will is not a patient but a friend for most of the first season. By contrasting parallel, Dr. Alana Bloom's friendship with, attempt to maintain a safe distance from, and romantic attraction to Will are explored. The impossibility of maintaining strict personal and/or professional boundaries is often a component of pivotal scenes between characters, which emphasizes the strangeness but not the sympathy of the effects of the unfolding drama/s on characters trained (for their professions) in intrapsychic regulation of self.In addition to the portrayal of the intrapsychic functioning of multiple characters, we also get these dark, archetypal visual symbols. The stag, the antlers, the antler-headed man, and some of the antler-related murders have a mysterious depth and fascination precisely because such symbols are as ancient as as cave paintings and are automatically charged by our collective past -- when we not only weren't above the beasts, we were *of* the beasts, merely one link in the food chain... not even the top link.The hunter vs. hunted, beast vs. human, consumer vs. consumed themes, and the mythological roots of cannibalism,  run through the entire first season of Hannibal. The visual use of the stag and the antlered man conjure intimations of dark, instinctual, bestial behavior in our collective uncivilized, prehistoric human past, still present in humans today whether we want to admit it or not. The madness of the bull elk or moose, or the buck deer, during rut is also associated with these symbols -- and I don't mean in a sexual sense, I mean in the sense of the violent elimination of rival males.**Sadly, that is why the CGI stag is my one major disappointment and my biggest (maybe only) pet peeve on Hannibal. I can forgive many things on this show because the execution is damn near perfect. However, the CGI stag is unforgivable. It lowers the overall quality of the show, it's so badly done.I can forgive all the other unrealistic things that threaten to yank me out of the my suspension of disbelief... but I don't understand why they could get six trained dogs for the production (Will's collected strays) and yet couldn't get a trained or even animatronic stag. The CGI stag is so badly done, it fails to mesh with the rest of the visuals far more often than it meshes. It is often not even to scale with other parts of scenes, such as trees!For anyone who has seen a bull elk or 8-10 point (or more) buck deer up close (too close, maybe), the CGI stag is laughable.The lack of realism of the CGI stag isn't the point. I GET that it is supposed to be unreal; it's always part of a dream/nightmare sequence or a delusion.But it should not be so unreal and so badly done as to call attention to its CGI-ness. The best CGI is nearly indistinguishable from reality. Hannibal's CGI stag is really, really badly done. I don't understand what the producers were thinking. It is so subpar and seems so low budget, in comparison to the rest of the uniformly high production values, that the psychological impact of the symbol itself is lost and uintentionally becomes almost comic. It inevitably and rudely punctures one's suspension of disbelief.I get the sense that the people who created/programmed the CGI stag have never seen a real stag or bull elk up close, even NOT in the period of rut. Such people have no business creating a CGI stag. Seriously. It is that bad.At any rate, the &#34;meat&#34; of Hannibal (pun intended) is very much about when it is and is not healthy to maintain strict demarcations between self and other -- psychically and physically.I don't believe a character on the autism spectrum, the way Will Graham is written and portrayed, would be capable of an &#34;empathy disorder&#34; where he sympathizes with the perspective of those whose points of view he takes on, to the point where he'd lose his own identity. One of the (real life) characteristics about neuro-atypicals (on the spectrum of autism) is their difficulty assuming the point of view of another human (along with failure to recognize or appropriately process facial expressions, tone of voice, etc.).But such is the quality of the writing on Hannibal that even when you intellectually know different, you buy into it.*If you have read a lot of true crime, you know that while there are anywhere from 50 to over 100 serial killers operating at any given moment in the contiguous US, their sick crimes are nowhere near as sensational as the serial killer crimes portrayed in Hannibal. There has never been a human totem pole of serial killer victims, to my knowledge, and I've read a lot of true crime about serial killers.Why have I read a lot of true crime, especially about serial killers? I was 11 in 1978 when they started pulling bodies out of Gacy's crawlspace. We lived just outside Chicago, like Gacy did; friends of my parents lived in Park Ridge, the town next door to the town where Gacy's home was. News coverage of Gacy's crimes was inescapable: daily updates were on the newradio station my mom listened to in the mornings as she got us all ready for school; they were all over the evening and nightly news my parents watched after dinner.Early in the 70s, I was sent to my room to play when VietNam War gore was on the nightly news; my parents didn't want me to see such things at such a young age. But several years later, I could stand at the end of the long hallway to our living room and see and hear the news about Gacy on the TV in our fake fireplace. The entire investigation and the tallying up of Gacy's victims is indelibly imprinted on my memories and is an unfortunate societal milestone of my late childhood. Though I and my classmates were still too young to understand the homosexual component of the murders (11 year olds were more innocent, then), we were terrified of and fascinated with Gacy. He became both bogeyman and threat. &#34;Gacy's gonna getcha!&#34;I guess that started my lifelong fascination with how psychopaths can not only live among us, but be considered pillars of the community until their crimes were discovered. Gacy was, after all, friends with a lot of cops, and was also a clown at children's parties. So I've read a lot of true crime, and a lot about serial killers. And while Hannibal purports to be about serial killers, Hannibal's killers are not much like real serial killers, including Abel Gideon (Eddie Izzard in a really great performance. However, I believe their struggles with identity are well dramatized on Hannibal.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "as much about therapy as serial killers", "unixReviewTime": 1398988800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3UBOD9N86350Y", "asin": "B00CB6SU5I", "reviewerName": "Mr. Music", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "Having worked in the animation industry as a composer for 30 years, and more recently as a writer of children's programing, here&#8217;s my detailed critique .THE SHOW&#8217;S LOOKWonderful coloring and color palate. This is not as easy as it looks. Especially in what they call FLASH 2D (2 1/2D&#8211;3D like shading). Though many reviewers complained about the look, I found it cute and very exceptible in the financial limitations they must have had. This is NOT a Dreamwork&#8217;s budget! It makes a difference.THE CONCEPTHaving a show that deals with art, when there is a glut of STEM shows (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) is not only refreshing but, adds a needed balance in the marketplace of children&#8217;s programming and some RIGHT brained thinking!INTERACTIVITY / A FALSE RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ON-SCREEN CHARACTERIt has been a concern from Dr. Dimitri Christakis at Washington University and Dr. Micheal Rich  (CMCH - Center on Media and Child Health) where talking out the screen (the 4th wall) creates an unreal interaction and relationship with the onscreen characters and your kids at home. For example, Arty, &#8220;Will you help count the crayons with me&#8221;. Young at home viewer &#8221;I can&#8217;t, I have to go potty first&#8221; Arty, &#8221;Great! Let&#8217;s do it together&#8221;.With scripting of this nature, there is nothing to block this type of exchange and resulting confusion. Though this is called interactive educational content &#8211; it is NOT. It&#8217;s not a two way communication scheme. Rather it&#8217;s entra-active (within one&#8217;s self, your child&#8217;s own perception of the communication). Questions to children from ANY show should NOT be directed for a response. Here&#8217;s an example of how it might be better employed.Arty, as he looks out the screen at your child &#8220;I&#8217;m going to count the crayons WE need. 1,2,3,4,5&#8221;. Your child CAN count along or not. It has an interactive feel but remains engaging while not calling for a response. In all fairness, I only found a few of these that were problematic in Creative Galaxy. My guess is, this &#8220;interactive modality&#8221; in &#8220;sit and watch&#8221; programming will soon lose favor. Where it does work, however, is on the IPad where there CAN BE input and a genuine response from a child playing a game after a question from an on-screen character.The common sense advice from media researchers to parents is&#8230; always watch the show with your children to catch anything that may be misunderstood or&#8230; inappropriate. Afterward, have a discussion of the shows content and activities. (see Kaiser Foundation&#8217;s - &#8220;A Teacher in the Living Room&#8221; / 2005 / critical studies and reviews of children&#8217;s interactive media)THE CURRICULUMHaving an art curriculum is novel. I can&#8217;t think of another show that focuses on art. How else would kids learn about &#8220;Pointillism&#8221;, &#8220;Jackson Pollack&#8221; or how to tie-dye. But there may be a number of hidden drawbacks to this curriculum as well.First, as many other reviewers have noted, the target age group and the maturity of the subject matter may be at odds. For that reason the show may be inherently limited in its scope and explorations of art forms and materials. For example, only using nontoxic glues, water colors, acrylics, paper and cardboard. As for Picasso, Mondrian, Johannes Vermeer, surrealism and Neo-romanticism and, the myriad of others styles, this may be out of mental reach for a pre-k to k-1 show. Still 13 shows (the industry standard number in the pipeline) may be enough to generate a lot of fun and exciting art experiences for kids. But, don&#8217;t expect one a week with 52 fresh an novel art ideas with projects to match.AFTER SHOW ART PROJECTSIt&#8217;s great to have kids get their hands dirty and dive in. The show is clearly sending the message of creative independence to your kids but, at the same time, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea. Parent/child activities not only foster &#8220;quality time&#8221; together, it&#8217;s safer. The on screen example here is&#8211;do it by yourself or&#8230; with a friend unsupervised.Additionally, having raised two daughters with plenty of artistic oriented homework and such, these videoed art projects also appear to go flawlessly. A little glue here, a pipe cleaner there and &#8220;Voil&agrave;&#8221;&#8230; it stands up perfectly. Prepare your kids for a few structural failures and for things that just won&#8217;t stick together as shown or&#8230; when their results don&#8217;t compare to the perfect &#8220;canned&#8221; examples shown on screen.THE CHARACTERSArty is a cute little guy, though the idea is that they are supposed to be aliens on another planet. Thus, the characters are in colors of green, purple, bright pink and blue with antenna. The voice casting is excellent for him and the other characters. Captain Paper is heroically over the top in his dialogue deliveries and quite fun.There are a few minor disconnects however. Though the mom is clearly an architect, dad appears to have no job other than to be a fixture/baby sitter with a little advice here and there for Arty. The other adult female characters all look like Arty&#8217;s mother. If it wasn&#8217;t for the different voice actors, kids might not be able to tell the difference. I&#8217;m an adult and I was thrown by the visual similarities, NEW alien skin colors aside.I felt Arty&#8217;s character traits were a bit forced, as other devices, like his antenna sparkle ball (&#8220;I&#8217;m lit up&#8221;) and that a treasure box goes in and out of his head through a cone or a horn. Then there&#8217;s space junk that&#8217;s all over the universe being used for art projects. Not exactly a Neil deGrasse Tyson moment for the reality of astronomy and space travel. So, be mindful. Your kids may take this show on its face value. In the &#8220;tie-dye&#8221; episode, you can find rubber bands floating around in space.Epiphany was my favorite character. Like a Greek Chorus of one, she (he?) is commenting on the action or mirroring it in very creative ways. She also helps the kids at home solve questions by answering them, or by morphing into the object being discussed. For me, this was a very creative approach to smooth over the conceptual speed bumps and was a lot of fun on many levels. A very charming character in my view.THE MUSICI&#8217;ve never seen so many negative comments in these reviews from parents about the music. So, let me ferret out this issue with a little more detail.The song writers are pop artists (Graeme Cornies) with some credits that are quite distant from preschool educational children&#8217;s programing. &#8220;Dark Rising: Warrior of Worlds&#8221; , &#8220;My Babysitter's a Vampire&#8221; and &#8220;Wedding Dress Wars&#8221;. On balance however he has just few credits like &#8220;Paw Patrol&#8221; and &#8220;Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood&#8221;. But it&#8217;s my opinion that&#8217;s not enough to have the preschool music genre in your DNA.Many other reviewers mention that they did not like the theme (which I myself did not care for). I believe this has to do with the melody going DOWN instead of UP in the opening lines. Melodies that go down in pitch&#8230; sound like they are losing energy in the start of a song. And, the harmony is too sophisticated (a contemporary rock chord progression) in the opening bars as well. For those who really want to drill down on this issue, the opening lyric line, &#8220;Creative Galaxy&#8221;, and its melody, usually follows the contour of the spoken words. &#8220;CRE-A-TIVE GAL-AX-Y&#8221;. Clearly the final syllable &#8220;Y&#8221; is up in tone when spoken. In the song, the final syllables all go down each time the phrase is repeated. And, this has the effect of being pulled downward. As one reviewer noted, &#8220;vocals manage to sound as though they are being dragged through molasses by the beat&#8221;Next, when a song for children is sung by &#8220;pop&#8221; artists, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it cool, it may add distance between your kids and the singers. Young children love to sing songs when they hear OTHER kids singing them in TV shows. They don&#8217;t relate well to slick productions, and, as one reviewer mentioned &#8220;pitched corrected&#8221; vocals. It&#8217;s NOT the sophistication of the music alone that causes this problem. Wonder Pet&#8217;s music is a classical opera in its form, but, it is sung by 6 year olds and&#8230; IT IS ADORABLE. If 6 year old&#8217;s sang the &#8220;Creative Galaxy&#8221; song, I guarantee you and your child will have a completely different experience of the theme music!Lastly, the orchestration (the size of the sound) though appropriate here and there in outer space trips, is generally too big &#8220;on land&#8221;. However I think the little musical punctuations work well even though the instrumentation sounded a bit large, I still thought it was fine.CONCLUSIONUnquestionably, kids love brightly colored animation and cute characters and can&#8217;t get enough. They also love ice cream and candy and want more of THAT too. As adults, if I may, WE have the responsibility for healthy media consumption for our children. Most all of the 5 star reviews are from 4 year old&#8217;s telling their parents that THEY LOVED the show and that THEY wanted more.  Where as the 3 to 1 stars where more from skeptical parents with mature concerms. A good place to keep up with shows of all kinds is at the Common Sense Media&#8217;s web site.AMAZON&#8217;S RATING SYSTEMThe scoreboard of stars doesn&#8217;t actually reflect the basis of the reviews. For example, out of the 300 five star reviews, 100 found issues they would like addressed. That&#8217;s 30%. The star scoreboard graphic gives the appearance that 4.5 out of 5 liked the show.  That&#8217;s a 90% out of a 100% favorable response &#8220;look&#8221; to the chart. So it is not visually representative.All that said, on balance, I liked the show VERY much, despite my detailed cynical critique. I felt the spirit and the energy was quite infectious and, above all else, its heart was in the right place. I would recommend this show to any of my friend&#8217;s children.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Professional In Depth Review", "unixReviewTime": 1404777600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE", "asin": "B00CDBQ9B8", "reviewerName": "cinephiliagal", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "FIRST, for the morons who automatically think \"animated = children's show\" -- this is FOR MATURE AUDIENCES. So for those who gave a bad review for the language/cursing: Does your spectacular stupidity come naturally, or do you have to work at it?Now then: This little pilot should be funded and given a chance for a full run. Unlike Big Bang Theory, which makes fun of the characters (not always affectionately, either), Dark Minions uses stereotypes and cliches of scifi and the now ubiquitous corporate office sitcom as satirical context for a buddies-against-the-system show set in the future in outer space. In a way, Dark Minions is to scifi and office/cubicle sitcoms what Archer is to spy stereotypes. The main difference is that Dark Minions' Mel and Andy are regular-guy/everymen who step up in an animated scifi dystopia comedy, whereas Archer is a comedic animated spoof and deconstruction of the international spy (ala James Bond) stereotype. (And of course, Archer's production values are huge, whereas Dark Minions are low-budget, for now.)Dark Minions is a little crudely done. Parts of it are flash-animated, like the animated comics of Season 8 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer (but not as good). Other parts are stop-motion animated/claymation. There is a brief intro explaining that if the show is funded, it will ALL be stop-motion animation (yay!). So, be aware that it's not just a pilot, but also a prototype.The characters are cliche on purpose; the dialogue is clever and humorously sends up the cliches. The premise: buddies Mel and Andy are non-evil, every-man temp workers for an arm of the \"Galactic Conglomerate\" run by evil upper management/villain, Drebnor. They're cogs in a big wheel, working jobs they don't particularly like 'cause they need the money, with no particular allegiance to the overlord/conglomerate. When the opportunity arises, their actions deviate from corporate policies such that they become unintentional rebels. Not entirely unique as premises go, but the execution is witty and entertaining.The ensemble characters are mostly-developed send-ups of cliches. A couple of characters are underdeveloped such that they remain cliches instead of being sent-up, such as Lance (who goes into a history of Mao Tse Tung and Chinese communism as Mel nearly falls asleep), DJ Wormhole (a GCS corporate radio \"classic rock\" DJ) and rebel girl Carly. The romantic interest between Carly and Mel is a plot device necessary for the central conflict and to jumpstart the story arc. But primetime sitcoms have been launched with less, and without the clever send-ups and entertaining dialogue.What Dark Minions does is humorously and imaginatively create a believable future sociocorporate dystopia, a context for the characters' and plot development -- to which most of us can relate. Since our economic crash and depression/recession, who hasn't served as a drone and cog in the wheel of corporate conglomerates, kowtowing to management idiots and numbing ourselves to the evil they (and we, as their tools) do because we \"needed the money\"?Between Mel and Andy there is a push-pull between rebellion and let's-just-get-the-job-over-with. Andy's stoner/slacker ethos is inherently more rebellious than Mel's head-down work ethic. Andy talks s*** about the corporate structure constricting their lives and choices, but he's less inclined to actually do something when Mel's conscience (and romantic interest) grab hold. Maybe Andy's inherent fear of law enforcement makes him less inclined -- or maybe it's amotivational syndrome from smoking too much 'xenofoliage'!I liked Drebnor as upper management villain. He's looks like an animated cross between Stacy Keach, Powers Boothe, and Swearingen (Ian McShane) from Deadwood. (He also sounds a bit like Ian McShane, but is voiced by Clancy Brown.) Drebnor is a comic portrayal of the banality of evil, surprisingly funny. And although he's *an* evil overlord, he's not THE evil overlord: there's clearly a corporate structure above him dictating policy and demanding he meet metrics, which makes him almost sympathetic. Feldenbaum is Drebnor's number two guy, kind of a cross between executive assistant and middle management. He's ready with the meeting agenda and the corporate memos and only very slightly sycophantic. Richard Kind is perfectly voice-cast as Feldenbaum.Because the animation is a bit crude, what makes this sparkle is the dialogue and world-building. It doesn't hurt that it doesn't take itself too seriously -- it portrays evil in the way Terry Gilliam's Brazil does, though much, much lower budget. Ironically, that gives the world-building more impact than a serious, dramatic rendition would.Some bits of dialogue that made me laugh out loud follow. Scenes are separated by -----.Mel: Did you just ask me if there is a designated day for 'random inspection'?-----Andy: I'm here, aren't I? And I'm barely high.-----Andy [after the two are teleported down to a GCS-invaded planet to reclaim equipment after a battle]: Wanna smoke a bowl?Mel: Are you outta your mind? We're on official GCS business!Andy: It's good s*** from planet Cathubitine.Mel: No, thanks! Last time I smoked that stuff, I slept with a lizard creature.Andy: How was that?Mel: Sex was great. The alimony is killing me.Carly [surprising them]: Ha! One move, and I'll turn you both into vapor!Andy: Nothing! What? It's prescription!Carly: You guys are with the GC!Mel: GC? Us? Like we would ever work for those ...evil guys. No, no, we're just rummaging... we're... antiques dealers.Andy: Just rummaging. We like to rummage.Mel: We found these uniforms on some of the scum that invaded this... sovereign planet and -- they happened to fit. Perfectly.Carly: I don't believe you!Mel: If we were bad guys, wouldn't we have weapons?Andy: Exactly. No lasers, no plasma guns -- all we got are these crap clipboards.Carly: Antiques dealers, huh? Tell me, how much can I get for a mid-century oak flatware cabinet?-----Carly [to Lance]: They're antiques dealers from the R15 system. This is Mel, and this is ...Octavius.Lance: Carly, can I talk to you in private? [they go off]Mel: [whispers] 'Octavius'?Andy: One, I'm not giving my real name, you sucker, and Two, these guys are rebels! Let's get teleported outta here, before we're busted for treason!Mel: Uh, hang tight.Andy: Hang tight!? No! You're all for playing it safe until the foxy rebel chick shows up -- and then you're the big thrill-seeker!? I'll tell you what: next time we're on Cathubitine, I'll get you a hooker with five vaginas. But this, right here? This is gonna get us fed to that octo-monster in the basement!-----Feldenbaum: I gotta tell ya, we don't step up our devastation and our enslavement numbers, the Galactic Overlord's going to [points to memo on clipboard] 'restructure our human resources'.Drebnor: What does that mean?Feldenbaum: Most of us are gonna get sucked through the airlock, but SOME of us will be fed to that weird alien, down in F sector.Drebnor: Not the one that looks like an octopus with fangs?Feldenbaum: Yeah.Drebnor: Ooooh, well, we don't want that! Okay, good to know. Next on the agenda?Feldenbaum: Well, sir, our plans to utilize the new super-weapon?Drebnor: Oh, good! Yes! Mwaha, the 'Planet Buster'!Feldenbaum: Well, the device is ready sir, yes, but we've hit a bit of a snag. It seems that we can no longer refer to it as a 'Planet buster'.Drebnor: Why not? I like that. I came up with that!Feldenbaum: It turns out that there's a company in the outer rim that has a device called a 'Moon Buster'.Drebnor: Well, that's not the same thing!Feldenbaum: Apparently, Legal thinks it's close enough.Drebnor: So what are we supposed to do? Destroy an entire planet with a generic unnamed super-weapon? That's an embarrassment!Feldenbaum: Well, how 'bout 'World Wacker'?Drebnor: Ugh.Feldenbaum: How 'bout 'Planet-B-Gone'?Drebnor: No, I'm not loving it.Feldenbaum: Uh, 'End of Days Helper'?Drebnor: It's too cutesie! Look, are we destroying a civilization, or are we throwing a birthday party, here?Feldenbaum: Well, sir, the  plan was to destroy a civilization ON your birthday.Drebnor: Didn't we do that last year?Feldenbaum: No, last year we launched a puppy into the sun, per your instructions.Drebnor: Right.-----Drebnor: Well, like a lot of you, I was just a little kid with a dream: I wanted to go places, meet people, destroy civilizations.  I stand before you now as living proof that if you want something bad enough, and can raise enough capital to hijack an election and form a space junta, anything is possible!-----Okay, it's not scintillating, but it is offbeat and funny. Other humorous touches include: while Mel and Andy try to break into the monitored communication channels, a screens pops up with a special alert. While the CNN-like talking head reports new developments with traitors (and reminds workers that clogging toilets with toilet paper is punishable by death), the crawler at the bottom of the screen transmits a mixture of corporate newsletter, lunchroom whiteboard, policy reminders, and oppression. To wit:FLU SHOTS ARE NOW MANDATORY AND AVAILABLE IN CHERRY AND CAFFE MOCHA...REMEMBER TO BE FRIENDLY AND REPORT ANYONE WHO ISN'TCONGRATULATIONS TO STEPHEN AND XITHAP GREENBLATT ON THEIR NEW ARRIVAL. AARON!PLEASE LABEL YOUR LUNCHES IF YOU'RE STORING THEM IN COMMON ROOM REFRIGERATORS!DO AS YOU'RE TOLD!FRIDAY IS FLAVORED COFFEE DAY!QUESTIONS=PUNISHMENT!The technical aspects need to be polished, of course. But I think Dark Minions more than makes up for the technical drawbacks with the dialogue, premise, and world-building. What makes it funny is that it is only a slightly exaggerated version of our own world, tossed into space, where the evil is an ever-present corporatism that dictates how people will not only work but also how they will live, and punishes most misbehavior by death that in our real world would be punished by write-ups and firing.Dark Minions shows promise. It was an enjoyable 24 minutes and 47 seconds and bears repeat viewing, too. If it's made into a full blown stop-motion animated series (which is what they say will happen if it's funded), I'll watch -- it's a show I can see getting even better as it goes along.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "satirized scifi tropes+satirized office temp tropes=worth watching (and making more)", "unixReviewTime": 1366502400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A1WA032VVW2PC1", "asin": "B00CXI81J4", "reviewerName": "neichan \"neichan\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Hmmm. Well, the plots are good, I'm enjoying the jump into Celtic mythology, Stiles is perking up, very involved in figuring it all out, but obviously it is going to take time. Lydia has joined Stiles as a part of the super brain trust dyad, that'll be fun to watch. The most recent episode I've watched, Motel California, revealed a lot of background on our werewolf teammates. Creepy episode with a lot of triggers, and daring. Once again Lydia and Stiles work together, this time with Allison, to ride to the rescue. Lydia has the absolute best horror-face. Stiles is so much better with each episode. He's going nuts with the snarking, he and Coach were especially watchable.Allison. The redemption arc. Huh. It is as if last season never happened. Well, there have been a few small mentions, but the girl went homicidally nuts last season. If you want me to believe she is all better, give me some more gut wrenching scenes. I do like seeing her and Lydia closer, bonding more. She is also sneaking around saving her werewolf buddies. OK. Maybe I'm starting to like her again.Scott has changed for the better, a far more likely Alpha candidate than he was when Derek mockingly called him an Alpha of his own pack. And there is more Stiles and Scott best friend time. The Scott/Stiles bromance in this last ep was fantastic, real tears! Great dynamic. Isaac and Scott are pretty cool to watch, too. Scott's voice is apparently Isaac's anodyne. Isaac is flourishing tho  little easy to anger, great closet scene, and how can he still be so beautiful. I swear the boys are even more so than the girls in this show. Wow.I think Jeff Davis still hates Derek and all things having to do with Stiles and Derek bromancing. A shame. They've had some of the best scenes in the first 2 seasons. Holding out hope for more this season. Stiles&Derek; scenes being replaced with Jennifer/Derek scenes... not fair substitute. Really not much in the way of heat between J/D. But again Derek is just lovely to watch. (For heat check out the way Isaac and Allison are looking at each other.)I do question what woman (Jennifer) in her right mind looks at a guy who is covered in wounds, bleeding black blood, who looks \"like you are dying\" and decides to jump his bones. Ugh, too icky. Something is not right with Ms Blake. She looks a little too True Blood hungry. Hope Derek is not about to be the Scooby snack again. With the new Alphas flooding in...the girl who rescued Isaac, and Cora, do we really need a gutsy new teach...Ms Blake, for Derek to (oddly, inexplicably) stalk/dally with (while looking that bored, Derek)? Maybe her role is one not so innocent. Guess we'll have to wait and see. If she turns out to be a baddie...then I'm back to the Derek is the exec producer's scapegoat again. Which I mourn, Derek is a great character, let him grow, don't stab him at every turn. Ms Blake as a sweet little love interest, doesn't fit. Wouldn't be at all surprised to see her eyes glow red.The Alpha Pack brought in quite a few new characters. It seems in order to be a member you need to kill the rest of your pack and take over their abilities. Hmm. Well, I find the Druid storyline far more interesting than the Alpha Pack. Dealing with a bunch of homicidal meanies/serial killers... well it is getting old. Kali's toenails are gross. The enforcer type Ennis was very one dimensional, and now is gone, gone, the twins certainly aren't one dimensional, at least they are getting more screen time which involves actual interaction and speech. Duke, is clearly unhinged, sticking his fingers into his own packmate's brain after his benediction kisses is the final proof of that, if we needed any more. It has been slow going, but he is finally creeping up to rival Uncle Peter as the guy to keep your eyes on. What can one say about Peter? That man can play it over the top without looking like an idiot. Duke...well, OTT, but getting better. In fact the whole Alpha Pack, OTT. And I don't think I'll ever get over the toenails.Looks like the Twins are going to have a conversion to the light side arc. But to tell the truth...Danny and Lydia, worth turning for, right? Amazingly hot Danny Ethan scene. Wow. Again. But, way tooo short. Seen way more on TV, right? Oh well, sweet is good.Derek got beat down again, tortured (see this Davis-no-like-theme?). His newly arrived sister is not listening to him, instead being a teenager, and a brat. Of course it is easy to see that the Hale family doesn't make calm, rational decisions much. Not any more. Derek is being noble, sacrificing himself, Cora is brash and doesn't know she is unprepared, Peter is up to something.Derek threw out Isaac, who is literally the loyalest of his betas, his little bud. I am disappointed. Sure, he might just be trying to save Isaac's life, doesn't want to be forced to kill him...but really, do you have to be such a jerk about it? Use your words, explain it. I thought Derek was thinking things through and might actually team up with Scott, Stiles, Isaac, Boyd, Cora, Deaton....and get something solid done. Maybe I can still have that hope. It just doesn't sit well with me to have Derek soloing again.Finally we get a peek at the Darach, too. Engulfed in fire, and maybe a little bit mad? Even worse, Gerard is still alive. NO! Aaaand, Ms Morrell is up to no good.Now we get to episode 9. God. Derek sure can pick them. More great stuff. Still a 5 star show.

The trouble is, the fact that it has such a questionable feel doesn't bode well.It has good graphics. Yay. But that will only last a little while. That's short term thinking. Here is where they could have made a four star product had there been better story or voice acting to back it up. Can Stark get any higher-pitched?The Cartoon has very limited plot. We're treated to merchandising sales pitches in cartoon form. \"Here's some gear we'll soon have on the shelves, and you kids are going to buy it because the Avengers are on it.\" The jet house, the team and the anti-avengers. All set ups for marketing. It's like the suits in accounting wrote the script.One great argument for a one star rating is that the characters are not very likable in this version. There is no room for each character's story, and thus as the team comes together they feel two dimensional and presumptuous. It is far less likely for the audience to forgive negative personality traits if we understand how the characters came to their conclusions.It's frustrating how, despite all their powers the Avengers keep getting whooped by the Red Skull and his tool flunky Modok. And yet, despite almost wiping the heroes out one second, Tony waves a magic wand and utterly and completely defeats the enemy, but somehow misses capturing them in the ensuing kerfuffle of petty Avenger-whining.Iron Man: Tony keeps saying that it was a unanimous decision to ax the Avengers, but then Hawkeye accuses Tony of breaking them up a second time. Everyone either attributes no leadership skills or way over the top ability and nothing in between. Unfortunately, Tony pulls a boner trying to save Cap where he doesn't really do much, kind of lackluster, throwing blasts around vaguely until, BLAM, suddenly he's got everything all figured out and, hey, perhaps he really DID know Cap was really alive and not disintegrated, but, no, he didn't know, and it wasn't us mistaking unrequited genius for a lack of talent. Stark comes off like a wiener who uses people when he needs them, and then cuts them loose and sends them packing the second they're not needed.Captain America in this version is the most wishy-washy, no spine-having-est, oops-I-let-myself-get-shot-and-died-est, would-have-been-spanked-by-the-red-skull-and-left-for-dead-had-not-iron-man-blundered-into-the-frozen-tundra-and-saved-me-est, non-Avenger-est Avenger of all time... except for Falcon, of course.Hawkeye: Not as cool, tongue in cheek as I would imagine. Aside from his purple sun glasses he could be a generic Green Arrow clone.Thor: Let's solve a bunch of problems, but how? Faulty toaster, can't get bread out? Mjolnir! Leaky faucets? Mjolnir!! Can't get a date on a Saturday night? Mjolnir!!! Is there nothing this hammer can't smash? How about a nail, like into wood to fix something. Nope. Asgardians SMASH... Oh, wait. Isn't that the line of...The Hulk: Slightly more intelligent than previous incarnations, but TRYING too much to be like the movie without actually BEING the movie Hulk. Banner MADE the Hulk in the Avenger's movie. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is the best out of the three Hulk-featuring movies, but this show does not even mention that the Hulk HAS an alter ego. He's JUST Hulk. This cartoon has Hulk constantly pulling the unexpected punch or finger flick that made audiences of The Avengers chuckle when Thor went flying in that museum. But this Hulk is also described by his fellow heroes as stinky and foul breathed with no personality other than an intense desire to smash things.Black Widow: Eye candy. She's there to strut in a skin-tight leather suit and bend into a pretzel for mid-puberty teens. Otherwise, there's nothing this version did that a really fit chauffeur could not have, even the nay-saying.Falcon: I know little about this character, but, and I hate to say it, but it feels a bit like a \"token\" to me. He's not the War Machine we've come to know. More like an intern who eked out a salary by being in the right place at the right time. He is NO replacement for Black Panther, who is NO ONE'S token. Black Panther earned his place in the Avengers, and he deserves to be there.In fact, all of these characters get dissed by Iron Man over and over and still hang on his coat-tails like he's passing out free puppies and snow cones. Even Widow, who is just self-aware enough to hate Tony and herself for dripping maudlin on his nice, shiny robo-boots, is compelled to hang on his every command.Um... Is that it? Geeze! Where's Wasp? Ms. Marvel? Antman, or Yellowjacket, or whatever. Come on!One last thought on storyline. The effects here play the vital role in holding this series, but it's not a good casting choice. Bring in a story arc that goes from one end to the other and isn't just a bunch of this guy vs. that guy. Put some thought and heart and effort into the writing and stop worrying about how much to mark up the cheap piece of plastic out of which you'll be making the new Avenger Jet.Justin Bently has a point about not comparing this series to the previous one. Really, this is a whole different animal. There isn't a tie in with the last one like, \"Ok, THAT happened, but now THIS is happening.\" It's a reboot, which means that they got to a point where they felt the last series got way off track (presumably) and now they want to completely remake it in keeping with what they've got going on in their current arena. I just can't see how, if it is indeed an attempt to bridge the gap between movies (primarily because they know with all the individual sequels in the works it is going to be a long, long time before the next Avengers installment hits the box office and they need to keep up interest) it is, in my opinion, a feeble attempt. I have seen the Avengers movie a dozen times (more for my kids, really, but I like the movie, too), and this just doesn't have the same personality.

Her Joe is literally as wide as he is tall, tough little bugger, except he's either narcoleptic or drunk all the time. Hard to tell.Teresa is the current Villain of the piece (I don't think the world at large is onto Caroline yet, but I hope they figure it out and soon).  She is hilarious. A woman of oversized assets, Teresa crams herself into clothing that is pink, leopard-spotted, shiny, feathered or leather-ish.  No color is too bright, no style too outr&eacute;.  For this woman, sequins are the new black.  But she's not evil. Just jealous.  She is not, let's say, the smartest anchovy in the bagna cauda.  A published author, Mrs. Guidice 'writes' cookbooks. Ok, actually she just poses for pictures among the recipes collected by some worker bees, but still, standing and facing the camera is, you know, work. it must take hours to get that make up on. And somebody has to round up the kids.  And oh boy, what kids.The oldest, 11 going on 45, is a world-weary cynic, a model and dancer, who seems to know way, way too much about the ins and outs of marital relations and family dysfunction, not to mention teased hair, hair extensions and weekly pedicures. All three little girls who range down to about five, are fighters and biters. They whine, they complain, they pose hands on hips and toss their manes. Just like mama. One can only hope they surprise us all and don't grow up into what we're all expecting.Anyway, Teresa isn't bad, she just envies any woman younger, prettier or slimmer. Okay, in her crowd there are not many, these women obviously like to eat and their spandex capris aren't helping things out.  Neither is the make up.  Lashes out to there, orange lipstick on gigantically inflated lips. I mean, the lips are so big, I'll bet they need ladles to eat soup.  And the eye make up? I'm not kidding. If you want faux mink lashes, black liner and Super-Extending Mascara, I'll bet you have to drive down to Delaware to get it.  So we know how Teresa must feel. Even with all the Special Effects make up, there is something simian about her face. She's not a beauty and she's not so young. Or so skinny. When she encounters someone who is, watch out.Mostly Teresa is jealous of her sister in law, the sexy and slender (by comparison) Melissa Gorga...prettier and younger and wife to Teresa's brother. Who is more successful than Teresa's husband, not cheating on his wife, and not under indictment. Who wouldn't be jealous?  The brother is also as wide as he is tall, but he does have beautiful eyes and at least stays awake.  Mrs. Gorga thought she could sing at one point, and for almost one full year we watched various producers show up to get big bucks from her husband as they tried (almost successfully)to pretend she had talent. Anyway, Teresa hates her.There are other men and women besides the core group...we have extra sisters and brothers, parents and aunts and uncles, cousins, one idiot cousin in law and one gay one, and lots of frenemies, but aside from all having world-class heavyweight keisters, they don't count for much. They change sides, gossip, wear awful clothes and have their own rococo homes.  We don't care about them.  It's Caroline, Teresa and Melissa who are the magic.Caroline is older than the others, a lot older. And fatter.  And she always looks unkempt.  No wonder she stirs up trouble.  Her children are extremely strange. The boys have no visible means of support other than some questionable 'PR' business that trades on their mother's fame. They appear to be pushing 30, both of them, and their mom just bought them a \"really classy\" bachelor pad in Newark -- full of leatherette furniture and what looks to be at least three faux stone fountains. One of the sons...the visionary...treasures a dream of one day owning a combination strip-club/car wash.  The daughter (after many seasons' worth of trauma and skin of her teeth graduation from manicurist college)now has her own nail salon, also courtesy of a generous mama.Okay, are you hooked yet?

Hill", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "As a longtime fan of Stephen King, I went into TV's \"Under the Dome\" with an open mind, knowing ahead of time that many changes would be made to the original story.  What I didn't realize was that the writers' intention was to keep the most basic elements in place, then write an entirely new story that bears only minimal resemblance to the book.  Here's a laundry list of changes that I see an either unnecessary or downright absurd, followed by what I think is good about the show:1.)  Linda Everett from part-time cop married to physician's assistant Rusty Everett, both trapped under the dome,  to Linda Esquivel, Hispanic female police officer in a small Maine town (??) engaged to firefighter Rusty Denton who gets caught outside the dome.2.)  Phil Bushey from zombified meth cook known as the Chef who hides out in an automated religious radio station to a popular contemporary radio DJ with ambiguous ties to the gambling underworld (???).3.)  Junior Rennie from a disturbed, homicidal psychopath with a brain tumor who sleeps with women after he kills them, and who secretly despises his father, to a slightly off-in-the-head, somewhat psychotic, but also sometimes strangely reasonable young man who craves his father's admiration and respect.4.)  Big Jim Rennie from a Christ-driven mini-dictator who never curses to a slightly religious-minded mini-dictator who swears lightly.5.)  Julia Shumway from lifelong small-town newspaper editor to disgraced out-of-towner who scrapes up a job in Chester's Mill.6.)  Thurston Marshall and Carolyn Sturges from a May-December tourist couple who find two young dome-orphans named Alice and Aidan, to Alice and Carolyn Hill, a lesbian couple from L.A. who are in Maine to drop off their daughter, Norrie, at a girl's reformatory.  (?????)7.)  Norrie Calvert from town \"riot grrrl\" who is friends with Joe and Benny to the daughter of the aforementioned lesbian couple.8.)  Dale Barbara from fry cook with a troubled military past to mercenary with a troubled military past who roughs up people with gambling debts.  (??????)9.)  Angie McCain from pot-head waitress at the Sweetbriar who gets murdered by Junior to Angie McCallister, Joe's big sister, who gets locked in the Rennie fall-out shelter by Junior, then becomes Big Jim's blackmail pawn against his son.10.)  Dodee Sanders from pot-head friend of Angie who also gets murdered by Junior to Dodee Weaver, radio sound engineer and co-worker of Phil Bushey who gets murdered by Big Jim for knowing too much.  (?????)11.)  Andrea Grinnell from the town's Third Selectman who makes Big Jim's railroading of Chester's Mill more difficult to concerned citizen who has no importance to the plot.12.)  Pete Randolph from clueless cop promoted to chief to Paul Randolph, crazed deputy who fires shots at the dome and kills one his fellow officers, then leads the town on a manhunt through the woods.13.)  No Andy Sanders (town First Selectman and Big Jim's scapegoat in the book), no Carter, Frank, Mel, and Georgia (the rapist deputies), no Brenda Perkins, no Sammy Bushey, no Reverend Piper Libby, no Romeo Burpee...basically, all subplots from the book eliminated.Those are just some of the character changes, which don't even scratch the surface of the differences in the plot.  For instance, in the most inept stab at a plot twist I've seen on any show, a new character, Maxine, is created.  She's a femme fatale crime kingpin (who looks all of about 25 years old) who gets caught in the Mill, has illicit ties to both Barbie and Big Jim, and begins running a fight club to make money after the dome drops.  Can I just say .... BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Okay, now that I got that out of my system, I'll follow it up with a heaving sigh at the inane butchering of a pretty good book.  As for other changes, you have to ask, was it better in the book, or is the show an improvement?  Take the case of Officer Randolph.  In the book, a young boy drives at the dome on an ATV during a town gathering, shoots it, and blows out his own eye.  That's replaced by Randolph shooting the dome after the town pitches in to put out a fire and accidentally killing another officer.  Personally, I think the book version is more horrific and compelling.Two more quick notes on changes.  One, the death of Reverend Lester Coggins is far more dramatic and intense in the book, with Big Jim and his son teaming up to finish off the meddling minister in their house.  On the show, Rennie smashes Coggins's head into the dome and it's over.  Lame in comparison.  Second, the show offers the source of the dome as a mini-dome with an egg inside that the teens find in the woods, then they carry it around, hide it in barns and friends' bedrooms, find secret magic spots on it that are like keypads for their hands, find a butterfly inside, see the pink falling stars from the book, put sunglasses on it and take it to parties .... okay, that last one was \"Weekend at Bernie's,\" but you get the picture.On the plus side, a handful of actors stand out.  Obviously, Dean Norris as Big Jim is a highlight, Mike Vogel does well as Barbie, and the characters of Julia Shumway and Officer Linda Esquivel are mostly good.  Other than that, though, much of the acting gets annoying, especially the girl playing Norrie Calvert.  The seizure scenes she shares with Scarecrow Joe look like something you'd see in a comedy.  Ridiculous conceits, like Big Jim several times dispersing scared, angry crowds made up of the whole town, by saying things like, \"Everybody go on home and let us take care of things,\" then the crowd just drifts away...these moments pop up frequently.  Political sermonizing, like Carolyn telling a skeptical farmer something like, \"We're a gay couple with a daughter, welcome to the 21st century\" pop up seemingly to push an ulterior agenda and inspire massive eye-rolling.  Only a few of the book's original plot ideas remain in place for this show, and its saving grace is the suspenseful way the plot is presented, making expert use of today's propensity for serialized TV drama.  Also, even though so much of the plot is different from the book, I do find at least more than half of it compelling and suspenseful, such as the showdown between Big Jim and farmer Ollie Dinsmore, Big Jim's complex relationship with his son....actually, now that I think about it, just about all of the plotlines that focus on Big Jim, as Dean Norris is hands-down the best actor in this series.I'll be tuning in and hoping beyond hope that some positive changes are made when Season 2 premieres next summer, but right now, I'm worried that the writers will continue re-imagining so much of the story that they ruin it with droll like the Maxine character and subplot.  If they find a way to right the ship, make the changes work, and bring the story back to some similarity to the book (which I didn't see anything wrong with, anyway), I'll come back and upgrade this review.

The case was worth watching, had a wonderful flow, it was actually interesting. The choice of criminal... well the actor was not quite up to the role, in my opinion. Or the choice was a bit wrong to make the character as he was, viciously goofy is the best way I can say it. He came across as more pathetic than anything else. Was there an intent to show that murderers are pathetic little creeps? I wonder. Some intensity was lost because of the murderer's portrayal.I can not explain exactly what intrigued me so much as a show without a compelling villain is usually doomed. Perhaps it is the actors and the beautiful chemistry they have as a group. The loss of one agent/officer, the oldest woman on the team was difficult. She was easy to watch, she captured my attention when she was on the screen. I was sorry to see her character go.Louis is a damaged but charismatic leader, he also has a great command of the screen. His ability to tie into, seem close to, people he has just 'met' is remarkable. The tragedy of his son's death and his wife's mourning rings through him, he is a man in pain, yet a man with purpose as well. He has lost much, but not everything. He is portrayed with an undercurrent of power and pain by an actor of great skill, Marc Lavoine. There are several scenes with Louis and Carl which show these two men are quite close, intimate. Beautifully acted.Carl Hitchner is an addict, clearly going through physical and emotional distress after being shot and disabled (by a child molester?), barely able to use his hand at all, and his frustration is bursting through. The morphine he takes is both for that chronic injury and for the emotional scars that riddle him. he is a man who needs a purpose in order to really live again. I was surprised at the ease with which he came off his addiction. Aside from that, the motivation was he had let his partner go into a situation without him backing her up so that he could take his pain medicine, that was credible as a reason he was determined to give it up or get it under control. It is not until the third episode that we see he is on a lesser opiate with the intimation it is helping him come down from the morphine. (My guess). I like this actor, he is brilliantly in character, has an air of ragged desperation that is well shown, but he remains a man with a talent, a gift at seeing what is around him, what clues that other might miss.Sadly, the woman who died, Sienna, the interrogator, is the most compelling of the female team members. She was quietly intense. I think that keeping her would have been a good decision. But I am interested enough in the show to continue watching despite her death. The bonding between her and the younger, sarcastic, defensive Tommy is entirely believable and is one of the wow moments in the series so far.The young man, Tommy, who is a bare knuckle fighter and some kind of gypsy by birth, is surprisingly charismatic. Also so intense, wounded, with a huge chip on his shoulder as well as a contract on his life, bought by his father. He is probably the manifestation of heart and courage in this show. Of course I am speaking just from watching three episodes. His meanness is never truly nasty, his well of anger, deep and wide.Ann-Marie is easy to watch, fluid and of course quite beautiful. I do not quite understand why she hides her injury, or why anyone would. Doing so not only puts her at risk, but her team as well. I hope there will be further explanation of this trait. It seems to sit oddly with her very responsible, intelligent character.Sebastian. I like him. The IT specialist and also a huge fount of knowledge. The combination of his high tech toys, what he knows and Carl interacting with him is fabulous.Eva is again, beautiful, She is also kind and determined and gives off a great sense of compassion in the right moments. In the third episode she stays with the woman witness who is dying in hospital and remarkably, managed to convey her sympathy without going over the top, not abandoning the woman in her time of death. I hope this will continue to be a part of her character.Donald Sutherland's character Dorn is as wonderful to watch as any role he has ever played.Setting the series in Europe makes the difference. It would be a good show if set in America, a legal \"Leverage\" perhaps, but watching the European locations, the glimpses of other cultures adds depth and more interest. I have bought the season on the basis of watching the first 3 episodes. While the well-oiled flow of the 2 part Pilot was best, the shorter third episode seemed a touch rushed, bam and done. It was still enjoyable to watch.I have high hopes the chemistry between the characters will continue to enhance the series, and that future episodes will be have me watching with as much pleasure as those I've seen so far. As long as the characters aren't paired up in romantic twos I think this will be good entertainment.I do curse the 43 minute episode rule. But what can you do? I hope for more two parters.Addendum: I have watched the subsequent episodes. It seems that in order to make things more interesting there has been a move towards making sure each character has a flaw, a painful history, etc. Hmm. I thought their expertise was quite interesting enough, but I see that there must be redemption arcs for some of the specialists within the team. Now, the question is..will your (or my) favorite character succeed or fail in their redemption? What havoc will be wreaked as they continue to spiral into the depths? Can they be forgiven?In the most recent episode a very pretty young man is taken, held for ransom, his parents hating each other with great venom, so naturally one of them uses their son to get revenge. Daniel is set up to look at the case in one certain way, perhaps because of his own wife's reaction to the death of his son. But we mustn't forget this is the second kidnapping. Dorn is traveling in Russia, seeking Dmitrov in order to avenge the Daniel boy. He needs to know Dmitrov is not involved in the kidnapping. Why? Hmmm, well, Daniel assures Dorn that he was not. But what about the first kidnapping. Was Dmitrov involved in the first one? Because the parents of the current boy taken, did not do that one. Is Daniel wrong? I am left with the question as well, is there a reason that it matters if Dmitrov is involved?By the end of the case... there is the question, will Hickman give in to the offer of taking a payment from the father as a reward? Did Hickman ask for money, was he joking? Is there a reason he shouldn't take it? I mean who could blame him for taking the father up on the reward, he lives in a ratty little trailer (complete with attractive women waiting to bed him). Really? OK. But... Hickman was joking(?)... while another team member, who we learned earlier had a foul vice, overheard and was not. 30,000 Euros. The team is already crumbling. Who is objective?

And unlike Dexters grand finale, Breaking Bad ended with an episode as strong as its very first. And if you'll recall that was a great episode.  The whole first season in fact, and the 2nd as well were borderline perfection, in terms of matching high pace intensity with a still somewhat believable storyline.  Just for the record, I'm not one of these die-hard fans that will say this show has never done any wrong.  No, there were a number of unreasonable turns the story took along the way over the course of 6 seasons, most notable perhaps in the 3rd and 4th seasons.  Favorites include the time Walt saved Jessie from killing the two dealers on the street (after just making some kind of \"truce\" with them at Gus's).  'Member that?  Jessie hears the kid was just killed and he decides he's gonna take care of those two guys and up he comes with a gun when suddenly OUT OF THE BLUE comes Walt in his car and runs those guys down.  What, Walt was following Jessie?  I think not.  Or the time when (we're supposed to believe) Walt was somehow able to half-poison Jessie's girlfriend's kid - so that he'll have to go to the hospital - and that somehow Jessie will think Gus did it???  What???!!!  I won't even mention the \"fly episode\".No, I am a fan of this show, and have followed it since it started, but while it was always enjoyable, if not always believable, and while it may have had a few minor rocky patches along the way, the last season, and especially the last episode really went out in style.  It managed to come full circle and tie the whole saga up with the just the right touch.  But what made the last episode so great?  A few things.SPOILERSIf you haven't finished the show, read no further!I have to think it's very difficult to pull off a really good last episode, if not a good last season.  Just ask the writers over at Dexter, also a good show which unfortunately fell on its face in the last season and especially the last episode, proving all's well that ends well (and unfortunately vice versa).What made the last episode in Breaking Bad so great is that we really learn a little bit more about Walt and it ends in the best possible way for everyone.  It's a happy sad ending.  Although Walt dies in the end, he succeeds in his life's mission.  We witness a man who has died somewhat content with the outcome of his life.  And by \"his life\" it may be more accurate to consider this the 'breaking bad' part of his life.  That is to say, the life he embarked on once cancer hit and he decided to make meth.In the last episode he finally comes out and admits to his wife that he did it because he liked it, and because he was good at it.  This was definitely not the usual \"for the family\" routine Skylar had been hearing for the past few years, and it reveals one of the motives for Walt embarking on this business in the first place.  Obviously providing for the family after he was gone was always a huge concern, and was initially the reason Walt got into the business.  But once he discovered how good he was in the business, he didn't want to stop.  It became something he poured his life into, a source of pride and self-respect, so that he continued to work in the business even long after he 'needed the money' for his family and so on.  So, this is an important revelation that we get as he's talking to Skylar in the kitchen.  Honestly, it puts me in mind of \"The Bridge Over The River Kwai, in which the captured British major becomes so enrapt in the process of building the bridge, that he forgets he is building it for the enemy!  Don't know if that's a fair analogy, but perhaps a bit of that in there.  But Walt's business did bring him a self-respect that he needed after the whole Gretchen & Elliot affair in season 1, where they offer to pay for his treatment under the guise of him coming to work for them at the company (that Walt helped found but never received any credit for).  That party was a big loss of face for Walt and as the seasons progressed we learned in greater detail the finer point of his relationship with that couple.  We learned he'd probably been with Gretchen prior to her leaving him for Elliot.  And we learned that Elliot had used many of Walt's ideas in addition to the name in his company.  As Walt found himself succeeding in his new business it became a point of pride that he never needed to borrow any money from those two.  And even in the last episode when he 'convinces' them to give the money to Junior on this 18th birthday - even then he insists that they only use HIS money if any taxes are to be paid, etc.  There is a 2-fold success in this event.  One, he has made it without the help of Gretchen & Elliot.  Two, his son (and his family) WILL receive a very large portion of the money Walt earned (it was close to $10 million, wasn't it?).  That was another huge goal of Walt's - not to mention every other gangster in the series - that the family be taken care of after he was gone.  And Walt knew he was going.  He knew that back in season 1, but here in the last episode, he knew it was immanent.Which brings us to success number 3 - crushing the very empire he'd built and rescuing Jessie into the bargain, or vice versa.  Now this was a very important element of the success of this episode, and the success of his life.  Walt had ALWAYS been very lucky.  Throughout this last season as Jessie tried to hand him over to the DEA, and as his wife and son abandon him as he tries to escape, we the audience keep shaking our heads knowing that however the cards may fall, Walt always manages to land of his feet.  Why can't the other people in his life see this and just TRUST him?  Ah, the frustions of the all-knowing audience..  In any case, just as has always happened before, Walt's luck stays with him right until the end.  He's able to slip Lydia reisin, take out the whole of Todd's uncle's operation AND rescue Jessie into the bargain.  Jessie who's basically become Todd's gimp, his monkey-slave chained to a lab cooking meth.  Jessie and Walt part on a good note - Jessie actually leaves the series alive, out of jail, borderline insane, but otherwise no worse for the wear!  A very nice touch - and with Walt as the rescuer. Something almost Christ-like in the way he forgives Jessie, rescues him, even offers him the chance to kill him before he goes.  Am I stretching it?  Very NICE resolution to the Jessie Walt relationship.  Like it has come full circle - Jessie free and on his own again almost as if Walt is now releasing him from his duties and putting him back right where he found him.  You may say that Jessie didn't come out of it with any money - but here is yet another success - neither of them want it any more. Jessie because he knows its all blood money, and Walt because he's already provided for his family and is now on his way out.  Walt spends the last few minutes of his life in the lab, musing over the equipment, as the song \"My Baby Blue\" begins to play.  Just classic.  Really beautifully executed.  (\"El Paso\" at the beginning of the episode was also great - perfectly encapsulating Walt's need to return for the ones he loved - and foreshadowing his fate).So, this is why the last episode was happy sad - and ultimately great..  He had lost his family, had lost his life.  But his life he was going to lose anyway.  Into the bargain though he seems to have accomplished all that he had wanted to from the beginning.. well, with the exception of having Hank killed.  No, it wasn't a perfect life, though by the look in his eyes, as 'Baby Blue' plays out, we get the feeling he's about as content as he possibly could be under the circumstances.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Success", "unixReviewTime": 1380585600, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE", "asin": "B00DVFR8QA", "reviewerName": "cinephiliagal", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I started watching this because of the interesting casting and because of the genre: another police procedural, I know... But I was hoping for something really good, and it seemed like it had such potential, especially with the casting:First off, I admit, I wanted to see how Diane Kruger was going to pull off being an El Paso detective. (I didn't read any of the pre-premiere entertainment press, so I didn't know anything other than, it was patterned after the Swedish/Danish original series, and Kruger was cast as an El Paso detective.) I gotta say -- she has amazed the *bleep* out of me with this role. I only knew her from Tarentino's Inglourious Basterds, and I thought she was really good in that, though I haven't seen her in anything else. (I just haven't gotten around to it yet. I have a very, very long Netflix and Amazon Prime queue and wishlist). Her vocal coach must be really great, but it's still all her. Yet that is so little of how she plays the role, I'm just getting it out of the way.To all the critics who wanted the Asperger's aspects of Kruger's character Sonya to be specifically mentioned and discussed -- seriously? Why? Is it that necessary to have characters \"tell\" us what their dysfunctions are, in completely unrealistic ways? Have we become that lazy as viewers? Well, not me (and, judging by many of the reviews here, MANY people agree). I know (and am related to) people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (the new term for everything from severe autism to Asperger's and milder forms than even that). None of them ever announced their disorder to anyone (for some, it was quite obvious, of course). For the more Asperger's-ish, they were just their guileless selves -- obviously a bit \"off\" in some harmless (and occasionally really annoying ways), but often very interesting if you can simply take them as they are and accept that they are \"different.\"In my opinion, Kruger has hit it out of the park with this role. And if I had any way to tell her to her face, I would tell Diane Kruger: Do NOT change a THING about the way you play Sonya.I knew from the very first episode that Sonya was ASD. It may not have been obvious to others who don't have ASD people in their life or family, but that's the magic of series television: things develop over time and you get to know more about the characters. The revealing and development of that character over time is crucial -- for me -- because that slow reveal illuminates motivations, actions, statements, relationships or lack thereof. Over TIME is the essential point here. I don't understand why people can't allow that to happen anymore... or why it's okay for Mad Men or Breaking Bad, but it's somehow not okay for The Bridge, or a German actress playing an El Paso detective, or whatever problem people have with the situation.Sonya Cross is a complex character, but I think Kruger has done an amazing job playing her; I would not change a thing. She isn't over the top with it in the way that Monk was with his OCD. She has the body language, the sidelong looks, the not meeting people's eyes as often or as continuously as neurotypicals, the off-set stance, the focus on minutiae -- but most accurate, to my mind, is her utter guilelessness, her matter-of-factness (about things non-ASDs wouldn't be matter of fact about), her unfailing and unflinching honesty, even when (especially when) it's socially inappropriate or awkward... and her great awkwardness with people, with conversation, with social interaction.I disagree with a reviewer who said Kruger's visit to a bar was unrealistic for someone with Asperger's. Sonya wasn't going to a bar to mingle with people and socialize (but I can totally see why someone with ASD, with their often very literal interpretations of situations, actions, and behaviors, wouldn't grasp that). Sonya went to the bar with one intent: the matter-of-fact pursuit of a guy to have sex with -- in the direct and utterly socially inappropriate way a highly intelligent, socially awkward, and emotionally aloof ASD woman probably would. That's why it almost doesn't work: she literally doesn't know the behavior or language she's likely to encounter, how to respond, how to play \"the game.\" While the scenario may be unlikely, it's not completely implausible or impossible (and Sonya wouldn't be the first intelligent, somewhat \"off\" woman to cut through all social \"noise\" in order to get laid).(I do realize how ironic it is that the nuances of the situation would be less obvious to viewers with the same or similar disorders as Sonya's. But while the writers are clearly sympathetic to ASD sufferers -- and probably even know/love/are related to some -- they themselves probably aren't ASD, which is why the series is imbued with so many layers and ambiguities that truly ASD viewers may not fully grasp in all their subtleties. Hey, we all perceive things differently, ultimately... I'm just saying there was both more -- and less -- going on in that scenario than the negative reviewer's perception of it.)But let's move on, because Kruger is not the whole show, although she's a major part if not the focal point. It's an ensemble -- and what an ensemble! Demian Bichir, with whom I was unfamiliar prior to The Bridge, is fantastic. Just watching his performance as the resigned, flawed, heart-of-gold Juarez Detective Marco Ruiz has made me want to hunt down all his previous performances, including his Oscar nominated role in \"A Better Life\" (which I haven't gotten to yet). Marco is not perfect, by any means, though; he has his weaknesses, which unfortunately are brought cruelly home by developments throughout the season. But his easygoing nature and his ability to tolerate ambiguities and soldier on, doing the right thing to the best of his ability within the restrictions and boundaries imposed on him from multiple angles, make him a very sympathetic character.Levine is great as the fatherly Lieutenant of Detective Sonya Cross; he \"gets\" her in ways her other co-workers don't. You can tell he knows she is a good cop, but she needs help with the social aspects of working with (and for) people; his subtle coaching of her is sweet without being smarmily sentimental. Matthew Lillard is so cynical and burned out he's practically odious as El Paso Sun reporter Daniel Frye, but he's not so completely odious that he's utterly unsympathetic. Emily Rios as Adrian Perez, the junior El Paso Sun reporter who's paired up with him, is also very good in a role that could easily have become a stereotype or caricature, and isn't. Annabeth Gish is handed a role that could easily be a stereotype, too (certainly seems to start out that way), but she sidesteps that with some surprising steel and verve. Her character's late husband's ranch hand Cesar, played by Alejandro Patino, is also really good. There are so many minor supporting roles that are so great on this show and really make the entire ensemble of characters believable.And let's not forget the obvious villains and questionable characters! Thomas M. Wright plays Steven Linder as well as Kruger is playing Sonya -- his character clearly has some deficits, for which he compensates, sometimes badly; his motives don't become clearer (somewhat) until several episodes in, at which point you see what drives him, how idealistic (and perhaps unrealistic) it is; then you wonder how much his past haunts him and what it makes him capable of. Juan Carlos Cantu as Captain Robles, Det. Ruiz' supervisor, comes off as one of those cultured, refined, upper class and upper rank slimeballs, only too happy to let the status quo stay exactly as it is, with a genial smile, easygoing fake sincerity, mean asides in Spanish -- and ever willing to enforce the status quo with brutal muscle if need be.Ramon Franco, as Fausto the cartel leader, is as outright brutal and vicious as you'd expect, but no less terrifying and creepy for it. But Alma Martinez, who plays Graciela Rivera, is as scary and creepy as Fausto and Robles combined, except more. She's a violent monkey wrench, not to be trifled with at ALL, whose behavior and actions you don't really see coming until they're in your face.Of course, actors can't do much with bad writing, which is the other reason this show is so good. The writing is actually very good. There are a few false steps here and there, a couple obligatory storylines that could be less cliche, but for the most part, the central conflicts and dramas are unexpected, an evolving mystery. The complexities of the characters, their interrelationships, and the complexities of the border and the bridge, the Texans and the Mexicans, the documented and the undocumented, the corrupt and the non-corrupt (on both sides), the saved and the unsaveable -- this is great TV. It just is. The unfairness of life, on both sides, for so many, is portrayed in all its ugly reality, with no sugar coating, and with the unwitting (and witting) complicity of many portrayed in all its nuances. This is not a sentimental show, but it is often poignant in unexpected ways.If you want easily solved single-ep conflicts with clues that hit you over the head -- do not watch The Bridge. I say this having watched way more than my fair share of police procedurals because I have a thing for the genre.But if you want a thinky, tough police procedural series that shows the pitilessness consequences of the border's hypocrisies and ambiguities, the easy violence and corruption committed every day on both sides of the border, and the disparities between lives and classes on both sides, with complex but sympathetic characters with vulnerabilities, strengths, and hidden weaknesses -- you will like this show. The Bridge is best when it does what the best police procedurals do: portray the truth-is-stranger-and-more-bleeped-up-than-fiction complexities of real situations and realistic characters in the area and with the people(s) where the show is set.I haven't yet seen the Danish/Swedish series The Bridge, which inspired this version... but if it's anything like this, I'm sure I'll like it. And I'll be looking for more from Bichir and Kruger and anticipating Season 2, which just got greenlit by FX.

It's a show about superhero \"lunks\". That guy at your local gym with the massive and highly chiseled muscles who smugly eyeballs you breaking a sweat on the warm-up setting of your treadmill is the Hulk. He and his group of work-out-machine-monopolizing, protein-swilling fitness nuts poise themselves to apply blunt force trauma to an enemy invader using high tech vehicles and weaponry that has almost no explanation for it's existence other than... yeah, it was just sitting there in the warehouse. The only thing is that everything here comes off as all-too-convenient. Who designs vehicle seats with the Hulk's bulky buttocks in mind, or a jet for that matter? And how did he get any of the tech he and his buddy Rick uses to hide out somewhere in the desert? There's no real back story for the characters. You really have to be initiated via comic and past features to get how all these beings are related. This leaves them feeling two-dimensional.Hulk is far more intelligent in this version, but it's frustrating that they continue to force his dialogue along the comic book path. He can perfectly articulate paragraphs of dialogue at one point (and also expertly manipulate computer controls in the \"Hulk Lair\" while doing it), and then suddenly Hulk am speak broken English in every single fight scene. Hulk is always ALWAYS smashing, even when it's obvious that he could and probably should do something else. I did not bother to count, but I'm pretty sure the WORD \"smash\" appears in every second or third sentence out of Hulk's mouth, and a few times from other characters as well.At one point things that just could not happen (as if anything here could) present themselves that make you say, \"Wha?!\" Who knew that when two cars are smashed together hard enough they will produce an aim-able fireball that can take out a sky-swallowing gamma maelstrom? The military needs to get on that one. We can make car cannons and put ammunition makers out of business. Just give us your old gas-guzzlers and we'll do the rest.I'm not sure I like the Marvel take on aliens. These green lizard-bugs seem generic, and that feeling is exacerbated by the reuse of the same bad guy swarm attack over and over.Explain the red hulk/General Ross becoming a good guy to me.There are a lot of unexplained factors here, like how has the Hulk managed to gain so much control over himself? Be that as it may, even when the red hulk gets mad he starts shooting and punching in a trained and professional way, never losing his intelligence. Generals in general (haha) have to be relatively intelligent, though not genius's (geniusi?) by any means. The problem is that Bruce Banner IS a Hawking level genius, especially concerning gamma radiation, and yet as the Hulk he can't maintain a 70 I.Q. unless he's underground in a hidden bunker. One of the things that always appealed to me as a character is Banner's constant struggle with the Hulk, and the Hulk's ultimately good-natured deeds. Here, Banner is a thing of the past and there is ONLY Hulk. That actually makes him feel less interesting.Man, I want this series to succeed so much. I'm a fan of Seth Green, so his appearance here was at first a cool revelation. Unfortunately, the character he plays is an extremely annoying Rick a.k.a. A. Bomb who gains his powers just by hanging around the Hulk and being obnoxious. What happens when you mix obnoxious and gamma irradiation? A. Bomb... and then a headache immediately afterward. At a certain point you just hope he'll stop talking and the scene will end. Mr. Green's talents could have been used in SO much better a way than this.Skaar. What to say about him except to ask why he's on my TV? He has no personality whatsoever. He's just a guy attacking Hulk, a Conan the Barbarian clone with a dose of gamma empowerment. Even when he speaks, he's just a tool meekly asking one dominant figure or another permission to do stuff. He seems right at home suckling upon that Hulky tate, but just can't seem to get out from under the random, miscellaneous villain's thumb. It's almost wacky the hi-jinx he must get into on his own; stumbling clumsily through boxes piled inexplicably along his path, slipping on the errant banana peal and spilling the fine china stacked on a platter in his bulky hands.I'm not sure what we need She-hulk for here, either, except as chauffeur. What is it with scantily-clad female heroines showing up just when, and only when, the protagonist and his tag-alongs need a ride somewhere? She doesn't have any stake in the battle. She's green and gamma powered. That's it.This appears more like a \"What if?\" divergence from the normal Hulk story arc where all the vaguely recurring characters become MORE vaguely connected...

I even tried to persuade my parents into opening a video store. it began my legit collecting obsession. So I worked to buy used VHS movies.By 1994 I had well over 2,000 pre recorded movies. Then in 1997, DVD was introduced and unlike Blu Ray, it was a game changer for me. Over the course of the next 5 years, I upgraded to DVD, and while I knew many of my obscure VHS titles would probably never see the light of day due to either licensing agreements, lack of popularity or whatever, I was into DVD and quick and glad to abandon VHS and all of it's imperfections (drop outs, frayed tape, degraded picture with every viewing, poor audio; nothing like a cat purring sound in surround, horrible pan & scanned videos in glorious 240 lines of resolution,etc.).. A few dozen titles were never upgraded, but with the help of technology and a DVD Recorder, they were upgraded, the labels and boxes were stripped and converted for use on the new personal/private DVD version.As some of these titles have eeeked out in the past few years, I then replaced those too... I have been VHS free since 2006 and there isn't a day that goes by where I lament the format that spurred my life's passionate hobby. I doubt that people wish they could go back to black & white TV's, anymore than I want to go back to that over sized & bulky 1979 RCA 2 Head Mono VCR that sat in our living room on top of the console TV.. I have fond memories of those years, but things are now better. I am in agreement with a few of the people that were  interviewed, that Blu Ray, or \"Boo Ray\", as one guy put it, sucks and is going to die out.DVD still outsells Blu, and at the end of the day, it does comes down to \"control of content\". Blu Ray was a device created to prevent piracy, control special features and to charge a little more per disc, because DVD's copy protection was easy to circumvent and Wal Mart and other discount stores drove DVD's prices so low, it made the DVD brand nearly worthless for the studios, profit wise. However, there's a reason Blu Ray hasn't taken off, despite hybrid combo packs and recent low prices - the format is greed, and the public doesn't care.As far as the movie goes, I thought it was just okay. It spent way too much time veering off into sub subjects (Japanese culture, people making their own home movies with a camcorder, etc.) that it didn't really keep me focused all the way though. I did enjoy hearing about how mass merchants rejected art based covers from their store and tend to agree with the people in the film, that part of the excitement of going to the video store and selecting videos was sometimes based solely on the box artwork... But this was a small part in the film and just as it got interesting, it got bland again.. Also, there wasn't really any mention of the 1984 supreme court case which ruled in favor of time shift recording, while it kept hinting at that subject when talking about recording.There was one small part where digital copies (like UltraViolet) are the next big thing, and I also tend to agree, because of the quality, accessibility on multiple platforms and devices, and the big NOW factor. I am concerned as was another guy in the movie, that again, this could just be a control of content mess.. and after I, myself, did a little research and asked questions, I discovered the following: Amazon, of course, unfortunately, does NOT support the UltraViolet program, so you do run the risk of having any digital video content become \"unavailable\" at a third party's discretion..until said content is then renewed by Amazon. I found this highly troubling, and again, as mentioned in the movie, goes against the spirit of what it means to \"purchase\" something. If something can be given and taken away, you're just renting it.. So this is another medium that is either going to sink or swim based on user control.This part resonated with me, and it's why I have only 40 Amazon Digital movie titles and over 1,200 on Vudu with most being UltraViolet compatible.. Which, btw, is where I purchased and saw this movie (Rewind This).. Last summer I had spoken to people at Vudu and mentioned Amazon's 3rd party position and asked what their policy was regarding purchased content vs. it no longer being available to sell, I was told several times, that your purchased content and UV library is forever yours to view and download. It just wouldn't be available for new people to rent or purchase. So this helped me make my decision to take advantage of the UV digital copy wave; and I've been aggressively building this virtual library over the past 9 months..Side note: If a title is UltraViolet compatible, you can access it on multiple platforms like Roku, PS4, X-Box, most content enabled Blu Rays, smart TV's, Smart Phones or a computer through any of the participating UV partners (Vudu,CinemaNow,Target Ticket, Nook Video, M Go, Flixster, etc.) providing said partner carries that title at their location.. Oh, and accessing and watching your library on these platforms never costs a cent, because it's your content.I recently had a chance to see this policy first-hand in December; I went to watch a few of my Christmas movies and went to search for \"Surviving Christmas\"(don't judge me, I pay my bills..and I happen to like the movie).. Last Summer I had done a low cost disc to digital DVD to HDX upgrade on this tile. The movie could not be found on Vudu \"for sale or rent\", nor on a few of the other UV partner sites(for whatever reason).. but I checked my UV library titles,and sure enough, the movie was there in my Vudu library, so I immediately watched it. UtraViolet purchased titles are in fact different from what's offered for sale on Amazon Digital.. You can download both for indefinite viewing, but Amazon's Digital contracts suggest instability issues..If I want to run the risk of movies disappearing on a whim, I'd still be with Netflix.. This film (Rewind) didn't really get into that either, though hinted at the topic.There's so many other things I want to banter on about, and while I wanted to love this movie for it's geekiness, history and delving into a world I'm so familiar with and love; I wanted to hear more stories from other true collectors and even strangers regarding their collecting and renting habits.. or even a mention of how Paramount first started renting their videos through Photo huts film kiosks where you'd get a catalog similar to the old Columbia House catalog and call and reserve a movie and then go pick it up..This is how I first saw Saturday Night Fever when I was 10... However,after viewing Rewind This twice (had to view it again to be fair, since I hated it the first time for being so touch and go), it just didn't hit a home run or even merit all of these good reviews. There were too many cooks in the kitchen, not enough experience or spice. Rewind This left me feeling bland, hungry and disappointed with it's many missed opportunities. Another odd part was the guy who remembers the \"be kind, rewind\" stickers as something warm. It wasn't supposed to be cute, it was so the next person renting didn't have to spend time doing what the previous person should have done. Moreover, those stickers usually said you were getting charged a buck per video if returning the video without rewinding it.. fees are so warm and cute.....It's nice to think about the past, but the past is now the past, however, most of the same movies are still here, and for the most part, they look better than they ever did on VHS and that's the point. The movies themselves remind me of the past, not the crappy format. That's where this film drops the ball. We had HBO back in the early 80's, and the signal was really horrible, but I never sit around wishing to watch Friday the 13th with snow and static all over the screen.. Nor does this movie make me want to hit the thrift stores, flea markets and dirty junk piles for old VHS \"gold\", especially in a po dunk shacks charging $9 or $10 per VHS tape regardless of the title because some nostalgic saps who \"love pan & scan movies over original aspect ratio versions\" and think \"DVD is broke 'cause it's got them black bars on the top and the bottom of my TV\" or that VHS is like Vinyl - \"it's gonna make a come back!\"... No, no it's not.. but thanks, have at it.

But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's a new update at the end of my review.]I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said \"In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story.\" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot-driven, rather than character-driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one-dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.Before you say \"They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?\" I expect good drama- character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful bookThe Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales, he describes the behavior and bizarre \"reality\" of patients who've suffered right-hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV SeriesThe Crow: Stairway To Heaven - The Complete SeriesorFairytale: A True Story. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year-old boys with high-level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super-elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).[Update: I stand corrected- as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded &/or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's- especially their daughters'- imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that.  All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think, link below)- and the hit showBorgen - Season 1too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin,He's Just Not That Into You, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense.  Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: \"Mix up the metaphors!  Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing.  Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!\" Or: \"Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity.  HEY! How about  SAVIOR- it's LOADED with associations, throw THAT in!\"  Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amassed, how much convoluted but simplistic drivel can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy- smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for.  If the show continues with this kind of writing I'll be one happy fan.  WELL DONE!Sadly, it didn't.  Emma tells the love of her life that she'd hoped he was dead, for no other reason than to set up the continued relationship with Hook. They couldn't have come up with a better line than that?  Awful. In the latest episode, we learn of Peter Pan's origin- another dazzling twist, dazzle purely for dazzle's sake.  Pan's Scottish brogue morphs into an English accent when he becomes a boy, unbelievably.

I waited for the Blu Ray release to watch this movie and so I came across some reviews beforehand that made me wonder if I should've just caught it on streaming first. Glad I didn't because I will definitely want to see this again (and again) in the future. Maybe a \"Dracula\" marathon, watching all the Dracula movies ever made, will be in my future.One of the obvious limitations in making a movie like \"Dracula\" is that you are bound by constraints. You can't just do whatever you want with it. Then it would be like, \"Argento's Vampire Movie\" and not \"Dracula\". When someone takes on a foundational classic in the genre, its usually to pay homage. So its even less likely, they are going to deviate too far from its blueprint. So, given that I've seen probably all Dracula's ever made, I knew what I was about to watch. Who lives, who dies, when, where, and how. Among other things of course. Well, it turns out that some of my expectations were false. No spoilers here but just know, that there is a little twist to the traditional storyline. A feminist twist, to be exact.Visually, the movie is lush. Colors are striking and there is much to feast your eyes on.  I really dug some of the animal transformations. Thanks for the owl vs. the usual bat. And the praying mantis. Of course, the wolves.... \"Ah, Can you hear them? The children of the night. What music they make.\"Acting was fine but my favorite was the Count. I have to say, I enjoyed seeing a more violent Dracula. While he is, as usual, self-possessed, when he lets his wild side out, its with a more feral and brutal flair than you usually expect from the Count.What distinguishes this from the pack is Argento's decision to empower Mina. Once you see it, you'll know what I mean and what I meant when I used the word \"feminist\".Its most trendy to bash horror films nowadays, and if its an Argento film, then its not even trendy anymore. Its a tradition by now. I enjoyed most if not all of his films and greatly for the most part. The only one that I felt let down by was Giallo, and I blame Adrien Brody for that. He acted like he was on valium throughout the film. I don't know why Argento allowed that. Regardless, I continue to anticipate whatever the Maestro does next. I hope the next one is even more enjoyable than his homage to the Count.I don't subscribe to the \"its so bad its good\" mentality. To me, a movie's job is to entertain me. I don't mean frivolous entertainment necessarily. There have been many movies I've seen that left me disturbed and as such, it was hard to call them entertainment. Still, they moved me, which is entertaining to me. They had a strong effect. It was like taking a trip somewhere I don't normally go. If I am entertained by a movie, there is no way I am going to say that it was bad. It did its job. I usually turn off bad movies. To me, bad refers to technical aspects of a movie, like camera work, production values, acting, direction, setting, lighting, audio, plot and dialogue, etc. Usually, there is a relationship between the technical proficiency in each of these areas and my enjoyment of a movie. But not always. I've seen some low budget, first offerings, where the production values where low due to money constraints, the acting ranged from adequate to not, but the whole was greater than the sum of its parts and it entertained me. I wouldn't call that a bad movie, despite its technical faults. I also wouldn't call a technically proficient film that failed to entertain me \"good\". The whole good/bad distinction came from the art snobs, high/low art. They congratulate themselves for being the elite who has proper taste and laugh at the plebs who actually enjoy the \"low brow\" stuff. And so people, without thinking, accept this judgment as true, though art, like much in life is subjective. The \"so bad its good\" is apologist. Why accept someone else's way of seeing the world as true, if it doesn't match your own? According to the elite, horror movies are junk, except for maybe Psycho (of course, Hitchcock), Rosemary's Baby, and the Exorcist, get a pass. Do you think the exploitation film makers gave a hoot what the establishment thought of their movies? Horror started out as subversive and iconoclastic. Subversives couldn't care less about the mainstream value judgments. If you enjoy those movies, why do you care? I say, go ahead and judge, if it entertains you, while I go off an enjoy me some good horror. Oh, and the technical aspects of this movie (Argento's Dracula) are definitely proficient. If you aren't sure about what constitutes proficiency vs. not, then check out the antithesis of proficiency: Witch Graveyard. Holey moley... I can't get over it. It should be incorporated in film schools all over the world as an example of the lack of proficiency.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If Argento had made a Hammer film....", "unixReviewTime": 1391040000, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A4FX5YCJA630V", "asin": "B00FVS44GC", "reviewerName": "R. M. Fisher \"Ravenya\"", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "At the time of this review, \"Dracula\" has not yet been commissioned for a second season, and opinions are evenly divided on whether or not it'll get one. Composed of ten episodes, there's very little here that resemblesBram Stoker's novel(beyond the names of the characters), and much that has been borrowed from Francis Ford Coppola's take on the story inhis 1992 film.Not that this is a bad thing. Although there's nothing out there that I'd call the \"definitive\" adaptation of Dracula, neither do I insist on absolute fidelity to source material,  especially with material that's as well-trod as the Dracula mythos (not to mention the recent resurgence of the vampire genre). As long as what I'm watching is fresh and interesting, I'm game for any reimagining. So what is it that creators Cole Haddon and Daniel Knauf bring to the table?This take on Dracula is a mixed bag of intriguing ideas and wasted potential, in which the titular vampire is wakened from a centuries-long slumber by Abraham van Helsing, seeking to use him as an unlikely ally in his war against the powerful Order of the Dragon.  Posing as an American industrialist called Alexander Grayson, Dracula arrives in London in the year 1896, eager to revenge himself on the sect responsible for murdering his wife and cursing him with immortality.Pros:The general premise -Although I'm still awaiting an adaptation of Dracula that is 100% faithful to Bram Stoker's original novel (the BBC miniserieshas probably come the closest), I like that this show isn't afraid to march way off the beaten track and present what is pretty much an entirely original story with a few familiar faces.Here Mina Murray is not a teacher but a medical student, Jonathan Harker not a lawyer but a journalist, Renfield no longer a sycophantic slave but Dracula's trusted manservant. Lucy Westenra is (still) a socialite but with a secret regarding her sexuality, and Abraham van Helsing is a barely-hinged professor who tenuously holds the reins when it comes to controlling Dracula's bloodthirsty urges. Though there's no sign of Arthur Holmwood or Doctor Seward, newcomer Lady Jane Wetherby picks up the vampire-slaying slack as an aristocratic noble-women who moonlights as a vampire hunter.Though Bram Stoker was inspired by the historical Vlad &#538;epe&#537; in his creation of Dracula, this adaptation makes the link between the two figures explicit, rendering Vlad and Dracula one and the same. And though Francis Ford Coppola was not the first film-maker to forge a romantic bond between Dracula/Mina, he certainly popularized the notion, and the conceit is carried on here by portraying Mina as Dracula's reincarnated wife Ilona - which naturally throws a spanner in van Helsing's carefully formulated plans.The production values -Make no mistake; this show is a feast for the eyes. From the set design (opulent ballrooms, candle-lit restaurants, gleaming solariums) to the costumes (the sumptuous ball gowns, glittering jewelry, Mina's array of cute little hats) to the elegant cinematography and soundtrack, everything about \"Dracula\" is stunningly beautiful. The world that they've created bears little resemblance to what Victorian London would have *actually* looked like, for there are anachronisms everywhere, but it has a unique style all its own, with a dash of steampunk and a glossy sheen.Performances -Forgive the pun, but all the cast sink their teeth in their roles with great enthusiasm. Jonathan Rhys Meyer seethes with his trademark intensity, but other standouts include Nonso Anozie as the efficient Renfield and Katie McGrath, who breaks away from her usual bad-girl role (as seen inMerlin) to paint Lucy as a rather tragic figure in unrequited love with her best friend.Jessica de Gouw is certainly very beautiful as Mina Murray, though after a few episodes focusing on her medical career, she's reduced to bride-to-be, damsel-in-distress and object of male affection, and Thomas Kretschmann is sadly underused as an otherwise riveting van Helsing. Peppered throughout the supporting cast are a number of familiar British actors: Andrew Lee Potts, Robert Bathurst, Jemma Redgrave and Neve McIntosh to name a few. Their names may not ring any immediate bells, but if you're a fan of BBC television I guarantee you'll recognize them.Cons:The storyline -Basically, this is the cast ofDraculain the plot ofThe Count of Monte Cristo, which is no bad thing save that one crucial element is missing: a reason to care. When Edmond Dantes is unjustly sent to the Chteau d'If for crimes he didn't commit, the audience is on the edge of their seat in anticipation for him to unleash retribution on those that framed him.Yet the alliance of Dracula/van Helsing versus the Order of the Dragon has no resonance to it simply because we have no firm understanding of why the vendetta exists in the first place. We're given a few flashbacks that depict each man's family being brutally murdered, but as to WHY the Order decided to inflict such punishment goes completely unexplained. Not helping is the fact that Dracula and van Helsing's respective families are complete cyphers, devoid of any personalities, whose deaths are a tragedy only because the show tells us it is.Also unsatisfying is the way both men go about wrecking vengeance. After a certain point you begin to wonder why van Helsing even resurrected Dracula in the first place - he leaves a trail of dead bodies in his wake, he refuses to follow the plan, and he usually ends up being more trouble than he's worth. You'd think that Dracula's involvement would at least have been justified by van Helsing's need for someone to inflict brutal violence on their mutual enemies, but not only does it turn out that van Helsing is more than capable of committing murder all on his own, but his plan revolves almost entirely around \"Alexander Grayson\" introducing geomagnetic technology to the masses as part of a ploy to undermine the Order's power by threatening their monopoly on foreign oil supply.Why'd he need Dracula for that? Surely there were others he could have called upon to impersonate an American businessman, and it's all ultimately negated when Helsing goes ahead and takes revenge on his mortal foe without Dracula's involvement at all.Damn love triangles -Is anyone else sick to death of these things? It seems that there isn't a single film, show or book these days that doesn't consider itself complete unless there are characters vying for each other's affection, often in childish and inexplicable ways. \"Dracula\" does one better and introduces what's best described as a love dohecahedron. Jonathan loves Mina, who is the reincarnated wife of Dracula, who finds herself drawn to Alexander Grayson, who is busy seducing Lady Jane, who notices that Lucy is also in love with Mina, who encourages her to express her feelings as part of a roundabout plot to drive a wedge between Alexander and Mina after noticing their mutual attraction, who goes ahead with confessing her love to Mina, who when rebuffed, then sleeps with Jonathan in order to get back at Mina... oy.All these love triangle shenanigans take up a LOT of screen-time and very little of it makes sense. Furthermore, the show ultimately presents Mina/Dracula as the \"official couple\", even though we're given very little reason to care about them. The actors don't have a huge amount of chemistry, the characters don't spend a lot of time together, and to simply state that Mina is the reincarnation of Dracula's wife is an incredibly lazy way of insisting to the audience that their attraction to one another is \"true love.\"In a show that has a vampire as its lead character, there's disappointingly very little vampirism in the show itself. Far too much screen-time is spend on these tedious intrigues, and they have very little purpose beyond getting people to lash out at each other in increasingly erratic ways.Inconsistencies -Yeah, there are quite a few of these, and most of them are pretty glaring. I've already mentioned the ultimate pointlessness of van Helsing's reliance on Dracula, but so many components of the storyline make very little sense. Why can't Jane, an accomplished vampire-hunter, tell that the man she's sleeping with doesn't have a pulse? Why would Lord Davenport, searching for Grayson's weakness, deduce that he's in love with Mina Murray based on his possession of a five hundred year old painting that depicts a woman who looks a little like her?Why doesn't Harker check his sources before publishing a devastating article accusing a man of treason? Having pretty clearly established Lucy as a virgin, why does she later look like she knows exactly what she's doing in the bedroom? Why on earth would the Order \"punish\" Dracula by turning him into an immortal vampire that could potentially threaten all their lives?We learn at one point that vampires are being drawn to London thanks to Dracula's presence there. But why are they gathering? Is he doing it on purpose? Does he even know about it?Other plot-points are raised only to be completely ignored. At one point Mina injects a dead rat with vampire blood and packs it away again before she notices its leg twitching. It's never brought up again. At another point Dracula investigates Jane's house, finds a female vampire locked up in her basement, tearfully kisses her hand and then returns to bed. And... that's it. Nothing more ever comes of it.Conclusion:\"Dracula\" is a glossy and stylish reinvention of the character that is not without merit - just without direction. I remain somewhat confused as to whether we're supposed to view this particular Dracula as an anti-hero or an out-and-out villain, and the dwindling likeability of all the other characters means that my investment in them faded as the episodes went on.Whether the show will get a second season remains to be seen, though as the bloodbath in the final episode kills off most of its best characters, there's a chance that even if it does come back, a significant portion of its audience may not.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "\"From This Night and Every Night Until They Yield - Blood Will Flow...\"", "unixReviewTime": 1394236800, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "AYG1U47VFZ165", "asin": "B00HALOZIA", "reviewerName": "E.

If you don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s the cat&#8217;s meow like I do, then I encourage you to check out her &#8216;stunts&#8217; profile on IMDB.com.  Bell&#8217;s the real deal &#8211; the kind of girl every fanboy wants to take home to meet mom &#8216;cause he knows she might not be good enough for him but she&#8217;ll definitely go down fighting for him.So I saw that trailer, and &#8211; with guarded optimism &#8211; I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get your hopes up.  Don&#8217;t overthink it.  Don&#8217;t hold your breath.&#8221;  Like I told you, I&#8217;d learned my lesson.  I&#8217;d been let down before.  I didn&#8217;t want to be let down again.  Somewhere in the back of my mind, I heard a little bird whisper, &#8220;Zoe won&#8217;t disappoint you.  You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;Well, I just watched RAZE &#8230; and it&#8217;s perfect.In fact, I&#8217;m so smitten with it I hope there&#8217;s a sequel.  And another.  And another.  I hope every film in the history of films yet to be written can take a lesson from its benign simplicity: when it comes to action, don&#8217;t spare the girl.  Why?  Well, here&#8217;s a few good reasons.  Sarah Connor.  Ripley.  Nikita.  Michonne.  Eva Green as Artemisia in 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE.  Angelina Jolie in SALT.  Uma Thurman in KILL BILL.  Milla Jovovich in any of the RESIDENT EVIL picks.  And Michelle Yeoh in just about anything she&#8217;s done.The more of them, the happier we fanboys are.Plus, it&#8217;ll only get Zoe Bell more work.RAZE (2013) is produced by Cinipix, Cosmic Toast Studios, and Quincy Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group under the IFC Midnight label.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly made flick, ponying up some deliciously delirious sights and sounds to anyone who&#8217;s willing to sit for it.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then &#8211; like with the film &#8211; you&#8217;re in for the time of your life: there&#8217;s a commentary, cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, extended fight sequences, a gag reel, multiple theatrical trailers, and no doubt a kitchen sink somewhere I missed: a sprawling assortment, which shows that everyone involved knew that fans would most definitely want to know more!  Bravo!HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  I&#8217;m not a fool.  I know that RAZE is not the kind of film that&#8217;ll please everyone.  Nor will my ringing endorsement please others.  However, as a lifelong fan of action films and as a budding aficionado of flicks dabbling in exploitation, I must unabashedly admit to loving every minute of it from start-to-finish.  It&#8217;s a no holds barred bloody knuckle brawl that should be celebrated by those who&#8217;ll love it most, which means telling most high-brow critics to go stuff themselves because they couldn&#8217;t possibly understand why it&#8217;s just so darn good.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me a DVD copy of RAZE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape or form influenced my opinion of it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worst Slumber Party Ever ...

It is assumed to be a virus.  Somehow, the CDC is approached to come and help with the situation.  Dr. Walker was specifically requested.  (This appears to be an important fact, but we are not told why.)The company with the lab is hiding what they are working on.  They won't tell the CDC, and they are lying about not working on monkeys.  An infected monkey is found by one of the CDC doctors.The story actually starts out pretty good.  I have seen the first 3 episodes.  The acting is good with the exception of Dr. Doreen Boyle, actress Catherine Lemieux, who appears to be unable to pick an accent.  Is she British or Southern?  I can't decide, but neither can she.From a suspense and action stand point, the story is well-written.  The infected people are angry and smart, and they have an irrational desire to infect others.  You never know when one of them will escape or reach out and grab you.  It is scary, suspenseful and a little bit gory.Most of the special effects, outside of the makeup, are more what you would expect from television.  Dr. Peter Farragut does an unbelievable Spiderman act where he bounds up into the ventilation.  The fighting mice are obviously CGI.  It isn't that bad though overall.  It is definitely acceptable to me, but it may not be to other people.There are hints of secrets that are untold.  There are two love triangles involving four people.  Eek!  Secrets like Dr. Hatake's contacts, Dr. Hatake's album full of pictures, are running throughout the story.  Dr. Peter's filmed secret hand signals, so his brother would know to run.  Who asked the CDC to come if Peter is telling them to run?  There are a lot more secret happenings.So why the 3 rating?Much of the science is just wrong as are the procedures.The air is safe because the rats/mice? are alive and the PRC test is negative.  Let's start with the obvious, what is a PRC test?  There is no such animal in the virus detection world.  There is however a PCR test, Polymerase Chain Reaction test..  This is used to detect viruses.  And how was the sample used to detect that there is no airborne virus?  A test would require a sample from the breathing area of the victim, like a bronchial wash.  The best way to take a sample would be biosamplers, using an impinger, if you want the actual air.  Airborne means what is coming out of the mouth and nose, and we know that yucky, infected gunk is coming out of their mouths.  The fact that the rats are alive mean nothing, since we don't even know if they are infected.  I would suggest putting the breathing apparatus back on.The virus was checked to see if it was cylindrical?  I didn't know that they were cylindrical.  And why was there a picture of what appeared to be a rotavirus shown being infiltrated by a helical virus?Those procedures for the strong, violent infected were just wrong.  Once you know they can be violent, you strap them down and sedate them, so you can safely work with them.  You also don't leave one person alone with people who are likely to become violent unless they are strapped down and sedated.  The idea is to keep them safe, the medical/science team safe, and the uninfected safe.  You don't just put them in a room and leave a member of the team alone in the middle of them.  Then after a team member is held hostage, you definitely don't repeat the same stupidity, but this show does it.EDIT:  I have now watched episodes 4-6.  The show seems to be employing the 'Lost' strategy.  There are more questions, more conspiracies, and I still don't have a clue about what is going on.  The only character I like at this point is Julia Walker.  I hope this show also doesn't go on forever without answering any of the questions it has raised.Edit:  I have now watched episodes 7-9.  People are switching sides like at a drop of a hat.  There isn't a lot apparent reasons for the side switches, except the company who owns the whole shebang is evil on a stick.  Major Sergio, who killed Dr. Doreen, is now A GOOD GUY.  The reason is he just feels bad about all the bad he has done.  He is a knight in shining armor.  And Dear (pick whatever you worship), I wasn't even surprised when Dr. Julia and Hatake had their \"Luke, I am your father moment\".Our newest mystery is why is this all being done for Julia.  With the overriding question, what in the heck are they doing for Julia?By the way, muriatic acid, ammonium nitrate, and potassium chloride are high unstable, explosive even.  This is what we are told in episode 9.  No, they aren't.  Ammonium nitrate might be if you heat it.  Ammonium nitrate and muriatic acid could create a rxn if combined, but I am clueless about the use of the potassium chloride.EDIT:  Episodes 10-11 and we still don't know what Hatake was doing, but we now know they are immortal.

That's simile.I'm not sure what was going on, and I don't guess that this show knew, either. I think the writers were watching \"The Walking Dead\" and thought aloud:\"Let's make a show about OUR OWN apocalypse!\"\"But, hey,\" another writer said, \"zombies are SO last week.\"\"Vampires have been done to DEATH,\" injected Jamie Kennedy, coughing and stuffing his face with cheese puffs. \"What HASN\"T been done in a while...or EVER (successfully)?\" They all shrugged their shoulders in a non-committal fashion and started hacking out the script for \"THE AFTER\".Putting aside the bong, they busted out the 20 sided die* they had from their Dungeons and Dragons game and made an alphabetic list of things that could cause an apocalypse that might be remotely entertaining, beginning with Aliens, and ending in Zombie-hybrids (leaving out E for \"Ear Mites\", I for \"Indiana Jones Impersonators\", L for \"Leprechauns\", P for \"Preying Mantis\", R for \"Rascally Rabbits\", and W for \"Wascally Wabbits\", much worse than the former).The only saving grace with the characters is that they were so fresh and original, no cobwebs to dust off these babies! A black prisoner innocently convicted, a white lawyer who's secretly corrupt, a vaguely hispanic female cop with everything to prove, a gay guy with a wacky day job, a slutty blond from someplace South-ish, a rich jewish lady with a spanish housekeeper, and... this will shatter your religion... an IRISHMAN who drinks WAY too much! It's preposterous! Am I forgetting someone...? Oh, yeah, the security douche bag. I think there was a protagonist too here somewhere, but tacked on in a slap-dash manner and thinly portrayed. Not worth further examination.That's called sarcasm.The featured characters are what Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter called \"Desperately Random\", which means NOT RANDOM AT ALL, but wishing to SEEM so. In THE AFTER's sense, it means that the characters are so oddly varied and/or paradoxically foiled against one another that it makes one wonder if they used that same 20 sided die to determine what half of the characters would be from the list: \"Harry's Hackneyed Stereotypes to Avoid at All Costs!\", and the other half just trying to make some allegorical diatribe about how things should be in a perfect world we don't have (boo-freaking-hoo!). Every time the convict talked about black folk in jail I wanted to slap him.Foil: innocent black man sent to prison for a murder he didn't commit vs. slick, white lawyer breaking the law by soliciting a hooker in a public stairway.Foil: same innocent black man with the \"CAN DO!\" attitude vs. the passive-aggressive white-spanish cop seeking to put him away, but ultimately, and utterly, ineffectual in any real sense. She was the ONLY authority figure in the ambulance and just caved like a jellyfish to the whim of the very guy she was sworn to capture. She would happily put away that innocent black man, but he's too busy delivering CANDY CANES and WHOOP-BUTT to protect the group, and he's FRESH OUT OF CANDY CANES, baby!I think the events that not even the police or the crowds stumbling around oblivious even realized was going on (...Wait, WHAT?!?!?!..) was that someone farted on set, and it was just really, really bad, so they had hours and hours of footage trying to figure out who farted. Seriously. Watch the parts of the show where people are just wandering vaguely here and there, scared of nothing in particular, but refusing to go back to their ordinary lives, and just imagine someone off camera letting one rip. You will suddenly understand method acting.At one point, all the people are racing around with luggage like they all remembered they had planned a trip to Majorca that afternoon and they're all going to miss their flight.Keep in mind, all this time there is NO ACTUAL APOCALYPSE going on. There are NO ZOMBIES, or anything else ATTACKING ANYONE, NOTHING is BLOWING UP, STARTING on FIRE, SHOOTING PEOPLE or BEING SHOT at BY people, and yet the mob of pedestrians decide to attack the group as if the \"heroes\" were Bogarting the latest iPhone design! It would be like you hearing a boom, losing power in your work, going outside, and then losing your mind with no conception of why you were there, blundering about for 45 clueless minutes and THAT'S when you see a group of folk in an ambulance and you just have to tear them apart with your bare hands for no particular reason! Why in the heck doesn't anyone just go home or back to work?Perhaps that's the reason why there's the non-apocalypse and suddenly a group that has no reason at all for hanging out together suddenly go all Scooby Doo Mystery Solvers Club despite their vast differences--or their secret sameness-ess-ess...? I don't even think the actors knew that the big-screen quality of the first 95 POINTLESS percent of the movie was going to sprint right into a cheesy \"B\" production right at the end. That's the REAL twist. Surprise! There's NO MORE MONEY LEFT to shoot this show. We blew it renting a wedding mansion, the 200,000 stand-ins, and these cameras. Good thing we didn't RENT the cameras, or they'd be going back, too.They really believed that if they just gave the group enough momentum that their pace alone would mop up any plot leaks, but it actually WAS the plot (or plot-synthetic) sprinkled all-too-liberally with brief, shambling pauses for character development. There's NO TIME TO EXPLAIN! Get out of the elevator! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the parking garage! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the street! Let's hear about those feelings. Get back to your hotel room! Now, let's hash out our feelings. Get in the ambulance! Quick, feelings? Bust into the mansion! Consensus... feelings? Sprint into the forest! Let's see how we're feeling. Get fondled by a naked, tattooed contortionist in grey henna! Feelings anyone? Get in your time machine and warn yourself not to watch this show... awe, dang. Can't do that last one. Show's over. Maybe time travel will be in the next episode. I have a... feeling that it might (could be F&%$#&G; anything, really).*Spoiler - They landed on D for \"Demons from the Netherworld\", and guess what? Each character has the same birthday. Hmm. Not sure that matters in the history of ever. Oh, but they each have a tattoo-like birth mark that together make some sick artwork on the back of the demon that stalks them for the last two minutes of the show so that it can give them shoulder massages in the forest. So, the fact that the SCG (Stereotypical Character Gang) are all suddenly so chummy and comfortable around each other is because they are all secretly connected despite having been introduced in an entirely (muffled snickering) random way. I'm blowing your mind now. Sorry. (SHHH.. its not random at all... keep it a secret...)I cannot even imagine what randomly (hehe) generated cinematic gold we will stagger into aimlessly in the next episode!

It's not even close. Oh, the producers tried...they tried very hard to give us everything. Every cliche, every stereotype, even every scene from every other TEOTWAWKI movie.Let's see. Band of hardy survivors. Yep. Wrongfully convicted yet innocent black man who we know will be the heroic leader? Got it. Sexy woman who wields a gun the size of a lacrosse bat and says \"Ah em trenned an' deddly\" in what might be a French accent? You bet.  Hooker with a heart of gold? Present and accounted for. Rich and spoiled society dame?  Drunken Irishman? Check and check. Gay guy in a clown suit? Okay, that was a new one one me. You don't see many of those. Probably struck the writers as quirky. We also have a lady policeman who is an imbecile and a lawyer who is there to take up space. Think Maryanne or Mrs. Howell on Gilligan's Island. They did slip up a bit with the characters. The Irish guy is the villain, and like all lousy tv show villains, he has no qualities other than being mean.  Sorry, but this is not in the stereotype playbook. A cliche Irishmen should be happy, with a twinkle in his eye, talkin' o' the leprechauns and the auld pub back in Galaway. It's the lawyer who's supposed to be the jerk.The adventure begins with our little troop getting stuck on an elevator. Almost 15 seconds elapse before they all panic, faint, go into semi-comas, and fight among themselves. Another a grueling moment goes by before they manage to open the doors and escape. This is where things go downhill. For them and for us. Mostly us. Now they are trapped on the building's parking level. Oy, already. The horror. The mesh security gate is shut and there they are starving and thirsty (yeah, it's been fifteen minutes, but back off), succumbing to mysterious illnesses and being attacked for no apparent reason by armed escaped convicts. And despite all this drama, the mesh fence shows no sympathy and stays shut.  They slap it with their hands. They shake it. It doesn't budge.  Hello, this is a parking a garage. Cars? Jacks? Tire Irons?  Fortunately for them, the handsome wrongly-convicted convict shows his leader credentials early, escapes, comes back like the hero he is, and saves them and now they're free. So what do they do? Get in their cars and go home like normal people.  Don't be silly. They all pile into a vacant ambulance and head toward the Rich Lady's house.Several adventures ensue. We get to see mob scenes that are comfortably familiar to anyone who has seen 'Walking Dead,' any remake of 'War of the Worlds,' or one of those Aliens Have Landed and They are Ugly and Have Issues epics. People run this way and that way, stuff explodes for no reason people push, shove, and trample one another, kids cry out for mommy. Helicopters randomly crash into one another. There are no phones, no power. Gangs are on the prowl. And just when you think our Survivors have seen the worst,gone through every syllable of recycled B-movie dialogue and every bad script retread, they go and spring The Big One us.  This is not just some Grid is Down/Bomb Has Fallen/Martians Are Eating Bakersfield adventure. It's multifaceted and complex. Boy howdy.  Get this. The survivors discover they all have the same birthday. What a twist! Why, this could be a discarded moment from \"Lost.\"And then, without even hardly giving us time to recover from that shockeroo...we get The Monster. One smooth glide from \"Lost\" to \"Lost in Space.\" It's not much of a monster. just a skinny guy with gray body paint and bulging red eyeballs. A sort of unwrapped mummy who didn't get much sleep. But don't snicker. He's scarier than the hairy rocks that used to chase Will Robinson and the Robot. But not much. And The Monster does manage to do an upside down backwards scuttle on all fours that has only been used only in about five or six movies since we first saw it in the Director's Cut of 'The Exorcist' about a decade or so ago. Anyway, that's how it ends. We are left wondering if this is a monster? Demon? Creature from the Planet 9 without his gorilla suit?  Or just a naked guy with dry skin and a hangover. Incidentally, although he appears to be nekkid as a mutant jaybird, he's pretty much Ken doll if you know what I mean.I wish the pilot was better. I wish we had a great new show awaiting us. This one isn't in the ballpark.  I'm giving it three stars because there is no sick little girl who needs special medicine and no lovable little puppy in imminent danger.

Always pastel in coloring with a soft and cottony look to it. Though it is limited animation in that it's mostly mouth movements, eye blinks and computerized figure morphing, it has a charming look and was quite appealing with beautiful backgrounds. Certainly aimed at a preschool to k-1 demographic.The ConceptI'm not sure what the format of \"The Jo B. & G. Raff Show\" is within the series itself. It appears that the show \"inside the show\" is always postponed because G. Raff has gone on an adventure all by himself and Jo B. is abandoned by his friend? That said, the interim resolution of needs is a great lesson for kids:\"If I give a little and you give a little, together we can meet in the middle\".However, it seemed like G. Raff got EXACTLY what he wanted and... when he wanted it.What's not clear is what \"The Jo B. & G. Raff Show\" is inside the show? I'm not sure it matters as we seem to have a little performance of it at the end of the episode. But is seemed odd not to know its content.CurriculumThe rest of the show's concept appears to be exploration by G. Raff of new places and things - what they are like and what's there to learn - G. Raff's discoveries. Here, the lesson is... to learn something new one must move out of ones comfort zone AND...  \"If I give a little and you give a little, together we can meet in the middle\" and learn something new! An SEL (Social Emotional Learning) basis for the show.Plot / Story ArcIt appears it will develop the same way each time. Jo B. will try to start the show and notice G Raff is missing. What unfolds will drive a novel plot structure. G. Raff is in a space station. G. Raff is in a rain forest. G. Raff is exploring butterflies in New Guinea. But the negative here for kids and parents may be abandonment issues.The CharactersFor me the character's traits are embedded in the voice casting. That's not a criticism. It's excellent voice casting and direction. However, what's on the page probably doesn't \"read\" with the flavor that IS imparted by these wonderful kids voices.Joe B., \"I like it under the sea but... we have to get home and do our show... like now\". G. Raff, \"Your right Jo B. but I've been doing some fantastic exploring down here under the sea\".Additionally the singing fish were quite fun and a novel twist on the plot.The MusicAs a professional film music artists, I can't underscore enough (ha) how will the music is done for this series. It is excellently timed and paced to the emotions in the scenes. If one could hear the dialogue tracks alone, the realization of what the score is accomplishing dramatically would be a revelation to the average viewer. However, as it is a complete executed unit, it's contribution disappears. But... it was NOT lost on me!ConclusionThe Jo B. & G. Raff Show is right up there in production values and content of the other Little Airplane shows. Is it as strong as \"Wonder Pets\"?  I guess that will be told in the other episodes and in the marketplace. Conceptually, my feeling is, though beautifully executed in every way, its format and style is not so strong as to totally capture the hearts and minds of preschoolers and their parents as did Wonder Pets.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A professional in depth review", "unixReviewTime": 1392940800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "ATW2Y3WYEQTOA", "asin": "B00IR6IB1E", "reviewerName": "S.

I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country (including the president's son), ALL are on a bus... a &#34;normal&#34; field trip... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found... AND no security ON the bus... AND a crazy ex-FBI (or other 3-letter word agent) is on the bus with them. Seriously! First, isn't a secret service agent to be WITH the president's kid at ALL times, WITH him, by his side, ON the bus? Second, none of these other high-powered people have security around their kids at all... and third, a field trip, a freaking field trip. Where the hell where they going? What field trip with 16-17 year olds? WHERE ARE THEY GOING?And... a secret service agent is suppose to lay down his life for the president and his family. They are NOT to be compromised. But oh... wait... if I buy into this premise, of course they are easily compromised.That premise within itself made me roll my eyes. Then it gets better... &#34;send the other vehicle ahead to secure the restaurant for lunch&#34; yeah, the one other secret service vehicle... WHAT?... oh, but wait.. it gets better... the other vehicle disappears then there is a road block... AND... let's get out of our vehicles and NOT secure the president's son and just see what's going on... WHAT?All of that in the first 15 minutes... I'm suppose to buy that... but oh...I find out that the show is going to be centered around a bunch of teenagers... ummm... no.Gillian Anderson, bless her heart... she looks good but that's about it. No emotion... none! And she did have a line for that something about... &#34;I'm not going to be this way for long&#34;... WHAT?oh... but wait... the bad guy, is of course, the BEST at what he does... which I guess is controlling everything thru his computer setup... and the FBI (or some other 3-letter agency) just fired him for something that he, of course, did not do, and let him go on his merry way.One positive note: The storyline with the new-to-the-job secret service agent was pretty good. IF I watched the show again it would be to see how he saves the day, which is where it is seemingly headed. I was engaged with this part. I wanted to see what he would do to save the boy and himself.I didn't care about the rest of the story. I just wanted it to be over. However, the series could be saved. If I was writing it, I would get the teenagers rescued in the second episode so that little teen drama is over. Kill the supposed bad guy and find that he was actually working for someone else so there are is a &#34;real&#34; bad guy. And have a storyline in there of how the secret service and the FBI screwed up. But the remainder of the show would be the FBI against this new bad guy and of course, saving the day.Anyway, this is bad. I could probably pick apart every scene. The suspense is forced. The story itself should produce the suspense. Suspense is not just drawing out a situation, making us wait wait wait for an outcome that we know is coming.At the end of the episode the bottom line seemed to be... what would you do to protect your child?... Well, it didn't seem that any of those high-powered parents did very much to protect their child by putting them on a bus for a field trip with no protection.

It is really cool that a bunch of kids are sent down to see if the earth is survivable.  It stays cool as long as you don't think about it too hard.Darn, I started thinking.  While this is a cool setup for a start of a new series, the problems with this premise abound.Let us start out with the very initial part of the premise, the space stations.  There was a deliberate vagueness about how the people came to be in the space stations.  If it was done on purpose, they would have laid in an adequate supply of back up parts.  They would have also provided ships with sufficient fuel to ferry the survivors back to the planet.  All of these supplies would have taken up a lot of room, which would limit the number of people allowed on the ship.  There was every indication that people would have been sent purposefully to the arks, since food, medicine, and other essential supplies would have run out long ago.  Another interesting aspect was reproduction and old age.  Reproduction was vaguely touched upon.  It was obvious that each family was limited to one child.  It was also obvious that due to a limitation of supplies that a sick child or a child born with a genetic anomaly would not be allowed to live.  What wasn't so obvious was that these parents could not be allowed to further reproduce.  In a closed system, any genetic mutations could have serious repercussions for the system as a whole.  It was also obvious that adults would have an expiration date.  Old age is a suck on resources just like illness.  The reality is that they could have spent a little more time on the ship, and this would have been a much cooler story.There were also problems that were not touched upon.  Let us start with gravity. Artificial gravity fields take a lot of power to create, and since they do want to return to earth, they would have to make fields that were comparable to earth.  Also, it would be essentially for bone development and growth in their children.  Radiation would also be a problem.  What protects the earth from ionizing and nonionizing radiation that is present in space?  Can you say ozone layer.  While there would be some protection rendered because the ark is still in the upper atmosphere.  The ozone layer would be unlikely to afford much protection-because the space stations would be outside of it.  No protection from the ozone means that this people are daily exposed to radiation from the sun and space.  They would have been more protected on the earth in a hole in the ground.  While these arks are a cool idea, they have a lot of limitations.  You can see why they would want to be vague about living in an ark in space.We find out that this mission is essential to assess the feasibility of returning to earth.  If the earth isn't survivable, the leadership on the ark will have to make decisions about who will be culled/killed so that the ark will still be able to support life.  Hmmm.... their decision is to send a bunch of kids who are largely comprised of untrained criminals.  They send no supplies with them and no means of communication.  That is such an excellent idea (sarcasm font).  They are provided no Geiger counters or meters to measure ionizing radiation.  Just because you aren't immediately losing your hair doesn't mean the radiation levels are safe.  They have no food and no weapons, and they have no immediate means of acquiring them.  They are directed to an old bunker, but after 97 years, there is no way to ascertain if the supplies are still viable, accessible, or even present.  Let's be honest, only in fiction would you send a team that is untrained and doesn't have the best interests of their community as a motivator to succeed on a mission.  This scenario lacks plausibility.  The show is designed to appeal to young viewers.  It is not designed to be plausible.  It is also designed to have many opportunities for young angst.The question you have to ask yourself is did the show have to be so stupid just to appeal to young viewers.  Ultimately, the answer would be no.  They knew that they had an insufficient number of pods for the population.  This would immediately remove the right of anyone over reproductive age of going, so this would make the cut-off probably around 35.  That would really be tough, but here comes the tougher part, the really young would also not be able to go.  If you are in a hostile land, small, crying children would be very dangerous.  This would make it unlikely that anyone 5 or under would be going.  It would also be likely that their parents would not be going as well due to their unwillingness to leave their small children.  And there is your 1200 people.They could have still had young people in the initial party, but they wanted to set up a scenario where there was a lot of mayhem.Here is the problem, mayhem and angst will only take a show so far, especially a show like this.  After a while, it starts to fizzle because you will only be left with the same mayhem and angst, and warring with the natives gets old fast.So they landed with no food, weapons, or helpful technology into a hostile world that appears to be rife with mutations.  Umm... if there were this many mutations in just a hundred years, it is likely that there is still a LOT of radiation.  Also, if mammals like deer are mutated, you would also be seeing mutations in humans.  You would also be seeing a LOT of new viruses and bacteria to which the little ark kids would have no immunity.  Oops, just another thing that was not addressed.Maybe the writers will be able to come up with a lot of new exciting scenarios to keep their audience transfixed, but honestly, I was starting to get very bored of the show.  By the time it had ended this season, it held no more excitement than the pilgrims coming to America and trying to survive.  And truly, the reason outlined for the fighting just felt forced.  Your ship killed some of our people.  I also am getting really tired of their romantic angst.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Hope they can introduce an exciting element for next season...because this was getting boring", "unixReviewTime": 1404604800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A3DN9249F3X716", "asin": "B00JMJOWXG", "reviewerName": "Corey Lidster", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "There is a scene in the first episode of Fargo, the series that takes the 1996 film masterpiece written and directed by the Coen Brothers as a thematic and geographic starting point, that I couldn't stop thinking about. Lorne Malvo, played by Billy Bob Thornton, a soft-spoken hitman for whom bloodshed is both a profession and a hobby, is pulled over after just leaving the scene of some fairly impressive carnage in a stolen car. The affable policeman, Officer Gus Grimly -- portrayed by Colin Hanks -- waits for Malvo to open his window, then asks him for his paperwork.\"We could do it that way,\" Malvo replies. \"You ask me for my papers, I tell you that it's not my car, that I borrowed it, see where things go from there. You could do that. Or you could go get in your car and drive away.\"Grimly chuckles, the Mag-Lite on his shoulder casting its beam in Malvo's face, \"Now why would I do that?\" he asks, as if delivering the obligatory question that will allow the other man to finish telling his joke.\"Because some roads you shouldn't go down. Because maps used to say 'There Be Dragons Here', and now they don't... but that don't mean the dragons aren't there.\" Malvo's tone suggests the statement be taken as friendly advice. He looks away from Grimly now, eyes on the road, signalling the end of the discussion, and a parting of ways.Grimly's radio crackles, and his daughter is on the other end, asking for him and addressing him as 'Dad'. The policeman glances in annoyance at the car and quickly focuses again on Malvo. \"Can you step out of the car please sir?\" It's not really a question and he's done being nice.But Malvo ignores him. \"How old's your kid?\" he asks, and examines the cop with a hint of a smile as the officer takes a step back and drops his right hand on to his holster.\"I said step out of the car.\" His daughter's voice is still plaintively asking for him to respond. His breaths are coming faster, visible as football sized clouds in the freezing winter night. The street is empty behind them. Malvo just stares into Grimly's eyes, still giving an impression of faint amusement.\"Let me tell you what's going to happen,\" he pauses, eyes searching the other man's chest for a name-tag, \"Officer Grimly.\"The policeman waits to hear him out, his deeply furrowed brow making plain his confusion. He doesn't know what else to do, so he listens, part of him knowing that this isn't right, he's the one in charge, he's the one with a badge, but he doesn't have cause to draw his sidearm... or does he? And somewhere else, much, much deeper, there's an alarm system screaming, telling him not to draw his gun, not to touch the driver door, to just get the hell out of there and never look back. But he can't do that either, he's a cop for Christ's sake.\"I'm gonna roll my window up, then I'm gonna drive away. And you're gonna go home to your daughter, and every few years you're gonna look at her face. And you're gonna know you're alive because you chose not to go down a certain road on a certain night. That you chose to walk into the light instead of into the darkness.\"Malvo is finished talking, but Grimly continues to stare. He squints, gives a slight nod as if requesting Malvo to further elaborate on dragons and roads and light and darkness. But Malvo just smiles, the same easy smile. His eyebrows raised, he lets Grimly decide which direction he's going to walk. When he gets no answer, he lowers his voice, as one might do when prompting a child to make a difficult decision. \"Do you understand me?\"Grimly knows he has to say something, do something, but... \"Sir,\" he begins, his voice a dry croak. Why did he say that? He feels a hot wave of shame crash over him, and then the cold of the Duluth night returns, and he realizes he is shivering. The man in the driver seat is still waiting for something more, but he can't decide what to do, what to say. He needs to clear his head and think about it...\"I'm rolling up my window.\"Malvo keeps his eyes locked on Grimly as the glass slides up between them, then turns away. The policeman looks like he's been hypnotized, watches with that shell-shocked, dazed expression as Malvo pulls the Ford Taurus back onto the snow-covered blacktop and drives away, his rear lights swallowed as the vehicle disappears into the darkness.While the entire episode is a brilliant example of an adaptation that builds on the original material instead of consuming and regurgitating it, that embraces the theme and style of Fargo without being shackled by it, after watching that scene I started to get comfortable with the possibility that Fargo might be one of the best TV series ever made. The show's creator and writer, Noah Hawley, has a very strong grasp of the complex dynamics at work, not just in the film version of Fargo, but in all of the Coen Brother's films. In some respects, the series is nearly a sequel to one of their other, newer masterpieces, the Oscar-winning adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel 'No Country For Old Men'. Just as that movie ends with the seemingly invulnerable Anton Chigurrh falling prey to the vagaries and uncertainties of existence, badly injured in a random car crash, in Fargo we are introduced to a philosophical sociopath very similar to Chigurrh, Lorne Malvo, and that introduction also takes the form of a traffic mishap, as Malvo crashes his car trying to avoid a deer. Dazed in the accident, his trunk suddenly pops open, and a man clad only in his underwear flees across the snow and ice toward the blackness beyond the range of the headlights. Thornton's portrayal of the ruthless and strangely mischievous Malvo is nearly as unforgettable as Javier Bardem's performance as Chigurrh, or the ineffably terrifying and enigmatic Gaear Grimsrud from the first Fargo, played by Peter Stormare. The Coen Brothers are unquestionably my favorite film-makers, and the fact that they served as executive producers on the series said a lot. This wasn't Spielberg, or Michael F****** Bay, this was Joel and Ethan Coen, whose names have never been attached to a crappy project. Amid the inspired crime spree cooked up by the fortuitous meeting of Lorne Malvo and Lester Nygaard (in an Emmy-worthy effort by Martin Freeman), it was the potential violence that was thrumming beneath the deceptively quiet words Malvo spoke to Officer Grimly that made the deepest impression. In just a couple minutes, the pleasant existence that he took for granted was unmade; what he thought was a life built on top of ten miles of granite was actually dangling by a silk thread over the abyss. And when his job had required of him the fortitude to do what had to be done, he had froze, and failed. Great stuff. This is as good as television gets.P.S.: While the series, like the movie, begins with a statement claiming that it is based on true events, it isn't. And neither was the film, although the Coen's said they had based the plot on a composite of several real-life cases. They said that the audience approaches a film with certain expectations when they believe it's based on a true story, willing to accept things they otherwise wouldn't... a sentiment echoed by series creator Noah Hawley. Whatever.

We were thinking it was going to be a normal adult comedy.  Well, we were right and we were wrong.  We actually left after about 50 minutes, but what I saw was so stupid.  The movie had an art house feel.  People get neighbors.  They are a frat.  They ask them to keep it down and things go crazy.  That is the movie, at least from what I saw.There are so many things that happen that just didn't need to.  Like the guy being able to get an erection whenever he chooses.  I mean, really?  It just didn't make me laugh at all.Some of the stuff made me feel uncomfortable.  I know this is a movie, and none of this actually happened.  Still, it made me feel uncomfortable.  Like when the two are having sex and the baby is sitting right there looking at them.  I know what they were trying to do, but it didn't work.  The guy starts smoking a joint and there baby is there.  That didn't work either.  The two worst parts I saw were when the baby put the condom in it's mouth and when the doctor told them the baby had aids.  He was kidding, but I didn't find it funny.I have this pre ordered.  I may cancel that and just rent it when it comes out.  As I said, we saw like 50 minutes.  But, it felt like 15 or 20.  The movie just has the same thing happening over and over again.  It was just a childish movie.  If they didn't have the baby, it could have been better.  It is like they used the kid as a prop.  It was a waste of $16.50.After thinking a bit more about it.I was thinking more about this throughout the day.  Here are my thoughts.This movie has three parts.One is, two people who have a kid and are not yet ready to live the life of two adults.  They want to continue living a life of fun and continue to be carefree.Two, a couple still feel young and want to hang out with people younger with them.  They want to live their life with the people they want to believe themselves to be.Three, people have neighbors that are driving them crazy, care nothing about their feelings and live a crazy life.I asked myself.  If any of these parts were taken out, would the movie have been better?The part with them having a kid and not being ready to live like parents. That could be funny.  I think they could have made that a fun movie.  If they took out all the random use of the F-word, all the sex and random drug use.  I think it could have been great.If it would have been about two married people trying to live like they did when they were kids or teens.  That could have been funny.  If they did a movie like that and took the child out, it could have been really funny.  With the kid not in all the scenes, they could have swore, drank, did all the drugs and had all the sex they wanted.  I would have laughed a piece of my ass off.If they did a movie in which a couple tried to get rid of bad neighbors.  That could have been funny as well.  It would all depend on who was trying and whom they were trying to get rid of.  Husband and wife trying to get rid of neighbors would have added a fun element.  The actions and reactions between the two would have made for some good laughs.The problem is that I don't see how these three things can fit into one hour and a half movie.Another thing I realized is that perhaps some of it had to do with the actors.  I am not saying any are bad.  I like all of the actors I saw.  But, seeing Zac Efron as a druggy, partying teen didn't work for me.  I do not believe I have seen him in anything.  But it just didn't feel right.Dave Franco.  He seemed like a good actor.  I do not know what I have seen him in either.  But it just felt like he was wrong for the character.  I cannot explain why.Another reviewer said something.  They said it felt like you were watching clips.  I thought the exact thing as we were leaving the movie.  Nothing seemed to go together.  No story at all, or maybe there was a story, they just did not pull it off.There is a part of me that wants to finish the movie.  I want to see if there is any point to it and what the conclusion is.  That is why I kept my pre order.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "One of, if not the only movie with him that I could not stand.", "unixReviewTime": 1400198400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2014"}, {"reviewerID": "A2HVL790PBWYTU", "asin": "B00LPWPMCS", "reviewerName": "H. Bala \"Me Too Can Read\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I think The Strain's making a home on a cable network like FX is perfect. Imagine Game of Thrones if it were on NBC? How diluted and emasculated of a show would it be today? The Strain requires, at a minimum, a PG-13 rating to tell its story. As it is, I'm really optimistic about it. There are some nitpicks.I've read the trilogy and I can attest that there are three bonafide human badasses in The Strain, and that our lead character, Dr. Ephraim Goodweather, isn't one of them. Dr. Goodweather (Corey Stoll) - or \"Eph\" - heads up the rapid-response CDC Canary team in New York. When a 777 overseas flight from Berlin taxies into JFK and then goes dark on the runway - its lights out, radio silent, window shades down (but for one, and what's up with that?) - Eph and his colleague, Dr. Nora Martinez (Mia Maestro), are deployed to investigate. On board they find what initially appears to be 200 corpses that reveal no indication of how they passed on. But there's this odd color and an odor of ammonia. Okay, Eph and Nora, stuffed in their biological suits, put their CDC training to work.It's worth noting that in the airplane's cargo hold is stowed a mysterious undocumented crate. But let's not pussyfoot around - it's a freakin' giant coffin. It's one more mystery to baffle the CDC.What I like best about The Strain is that it takes a more scientific approach to the vampire mythos, and that right away lends to a more realistic, more grounded take. Watercooler talk has it that Guillermo del Toro had from jump intended The Strain to be a television series. Except that them network suits balked to a man. So, instead, del Toro, with his homey Chuck Logan, wrote a horror trilogy that went on to massively sell. Now here come them network suits all up on del Toro's jock, pretty please may we make a television series? Del Toro must be laughing his what off.Vampirism as a disease? I'm down with it. I love that The Strain is presented equally as an epidemiology study and an examination of unsettling body horror. Of late, bloodsuckers have become these utter wusses, and sometimes, dammit, they even sparkle. It's gratifying that this show is ushering back the nasty, hideous, grotesque, gnarly, skin-sloughing-off vampire, the offspring of Max Schreck. In the two episodes thus far - \"Night Zero\" and \"The Box\" - the coffin's restless occupant has been shown only in fleeting cameos. But he's terrifying and is a blur and looks to stand at least 7 feet tall in his tattered cloak, looking like a damn Dementor.We're exposed to body horror, us watching the infected as they experience gradual loss of hair and teeth and, eventually, other extremities, and a type of tinnitus, as they become subject to losing control of their physical state, helpless to stop what's happening to them. Yeah, there's horror in that.I'm picturing a scenario: of David Bradley approaching the network execs, all humble pie, and asking them: \"Can I for once please just be a good guy in a show?\" Bradley, universally reviled as Filch and as Westeros' worst wedding planner, Walder Frey, plays the old pawnbroker Abraham Setrakian who once was a monster slayer and a Nazi concentration camp survivor. Abraham is one of the three badasses I mentioned. He's got a cane sword. Bradley is in prime position to steal the show. And if not him, then it's Kevin Durand, whom \"The Box\" introduces as the exterminating Vasiliy Fet, no-nonsense health inspector of the New York City Bureau of Pest Control. And who's the third badasss? Well, he's about to return a pilfered clock to the pawn shop.Del Toro has been quoted to say that plans are to have this be a five season series that adapts his and Chuck Logan's prose trilogy. It's off to a promising start, so I'm stoked. I love the upside. But there are missteps. One is that the show doesn't do enough to make me invest in Eph's secondary storyline. It concerns his ongoing struggles with alcoholic recovery and his attending his court-appointed marriage counseling and how he may not be awarded custody of his son. I don't care. Those minutes of angry therapy session were torturous to sit thru. There's something about how Corey Stoll plays Eph that leaves me apathetic to Eph's personal life. Which leads to another beat of frustration which, come to think of it, isn't Eph's fault. There are two moments in which Eph disregards pursuing a possible lead. One involves the pawn broker, the other is a phone call from that French guy what socked him. When I say it isn't Eph's fault, you have to allow that, so far, Eph and Nora haven't really encountered anything yet that smacks of the supernatural. So far, every oddity can be explained with science. But because we, the audience, is in the know, those moments are still frustrating to watch.Another gripe about Eph's personal arc is that the writers are in full manipulation mode in terms of making us sympathize with Eph. They do this by portraying Eph's rival for his estranged wife as this outright tool. As characterizations go, it's reeeeeeally convenient.One minor nitpick: The pilot episode opens with a peek of what happens in the passenger cabin moments before the airplane touches down. I wish, instead, the series had opened up with the plane already down on the ground and gone dark. I think it's more suspenseful that way and would've built up a more keyed-up sense of anticipation.Second minor nitpick: It amazes me that the coroner who performs autopsy on the airplane passengers doesn't bother with a hazmat suit, never mind that these cadavers had just been in a space that's potentially compromised with a deadly pathogen.Mostly, I'm thrilled. I'm loving the worldbuilding and the pace which I feel is just right. Reveals and freak-out moments are doled out with zest. There's a sense that there's so much more cool stuff being held in reserve, and that excites me. It's a smart blend of Old World trepidations about the things that go bump in the night and contemporary anxiety as triggered by today's big bad bogeyman - the infectious disease. For now, I'm all in. You ought to catch these episodes. Watch and witness David Bradley's redemption and soak in subversive notions such as love as the catalyst to the downfall of humanity and that while a cane sword cannot slay the common cold, it might cut a swathe thru this strain.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "the devil in a capillary worm", "unixReviewTime": 1405900800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2014"}]
